# Terms and Conditions
Please see below for the OCRS terms and conditions of service.

*The OCRS website, including all associated pages and material published online by the OCRS, are governed by these terms - continued use implies that you have read and understood them. You are responsible for checking this page for updates.*

## Copyright
Unless otherwise stated, the material and content on the OCRS website and associated pages is protected under copyright and must not be reproduced without permission. Fair use is (obviously) permitted. Quotes are good, plagarism is bad.

## Users
The OCRS site is open to all users, however enrolment on online courses is limited to those aged 16 or older.

Users with access to community discussion areas (forums, message boards, etc) should not use these areas to engage in defamation, aggressive speech, trolling, flaming, or whatever the kids are calling it these days. Discussion areas are intended to promote learning and understanding, where this is not happening, user access to these services may be revoked.

The OCRS is the final arbiter of what counts as unacceptible conduct in its discussion areas.

## Security
The OCRS presents its website and associated pages 'as is'. We'll do our best to keep you safe, but you should always take care to protect yourself and your computer from viruses and malware when online.

## Language
The OCRS is primarily written in English, however we are open to providing translations depending on demand and capacity. If this is something you would like to assist with, please [get in touch](/contact).

## Refund and cancellation policy
With regard to payment for OCRS online courses, you are entitled to a refund if you submit your refund request **within 14 days of the course opening** (i.e. from the date that your payment cleared and access to the course materials was granted).

You can request a refund during this 14 day period for any reason.

Requests submitted after 14 days will only be honoured in exceptional circumstances.

To submit a refund request, just email [refunds@oc-rs.org](mailto:refunds@oc-rs.org) with your name and details, explaining the reason for your cancellation.

Once you have requested a cancellation, you will no longer have access to course materials.
