# Privacy
We hate getting spam, don’t you? We only ask our users for data that’s essential to providing a fantastic learning experience, and we only send you marketing if you ask us to.

The Online Centre for Religious Studies (OCRS) will only collect information about you for the purpose of our legitimate interests, these include:

* setting up online learning accounts
* delivering online courses
* providing information about upcoming opportunities or items of interest

You are not under any obligation to provide your personal information, except any data required for setting up an online learning account (should you wish to create one).

We use <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.mailerlite.com/">MailerLite</a> for our email marketing, and <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.thinkific.com/">Thinkific</a> for our online courses - payment is via <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> or Stripe.

We also use Google Analytics on this site to monitor traffic; you can find out more about how Google uses data here: <a target="_BLANK" href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.

Other than for essential purposes with the above named organisations, we don’t share your data with anyone else, and you have the right to ask us to update, or delete, your information if that’s what you want. Your full rights under GDPR can be found here: <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/</a>

The information you provide will be held unless or until you ask us to remove it. You can withdraw consent for us to process your data, however this will result in the deletion of your account and you will no longer have access to any course materials or activities linked to that account.
