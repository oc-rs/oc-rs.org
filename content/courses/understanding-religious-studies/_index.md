# Understanding Religious Studies
This course will explore the world of religion from a contemporary academic perspective.

<div class="ocrs-content">
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi there, and welcome to <strong>Introduction to Religious Studies</strong>!</p>
    <p>In this online course we'll be exploring the fundamental basics of what a religion is, how and why people study religion, and also discussing some real world examples of religious thought, tradition, and practice.</p>
    <p>The course is open to absolute beginners; you don't need to know anything about religion or religious studies before we start, but if you already have some experience then you'll definitely find useful material and ideas as we move forward.</p>
    <p>Religion, I would argue, is a key part of everyone's lives; even if they don't identify as religious, they will live in a culture that is steeped in religious history and surrounded by contemporary religious phenomena. Therefore it's important to understand what religion is, and isn't, and to demystify some of the technical vocabulary that might be thrown around both in the media and in popular culture.</p>
    <p>For instance, what does it mean for Muslims to follow shariah in the West? What does karma mean in the context of suffering? Is yoga a religious act? Why is homosexuality considered sinful? What does kosher food have to do with God?</p>

	<p>Understanding religion in a respectful, but critical, way is essential to improving our understanding of society as a whole, and our place within it. We hope to give you the skills to engage meaningfully with religious ideas and traditions, to study them academically, and to build up a religious literacy that means you're better equipped for dealing with popular discussions about religions and worldviews no matter where you encounter them.</p>

    <h3>Style and content</h3>

    <p>My aim, in writing the course material, is to present information in as clear a style as possible - so I might sound fairly conversational - but occasionally you'll see an academic reference thrown in like this (Smith 2013, pp.23-6).</p>

    <p>Don't worry if that's gibberish, it's just there in case you want to read more from the original source of information. You don't have to!</p>

    <p>The references are in the Harvard Style, and will usually have the name of the author I'm referring to, the year that whatever they wrote was published, and the page (or pages) that I took the material from. This is called an in-line reference, in case you're curious.</p>

    <p>To find out more about the original source, just scroll down until you see a heading that says References, where the authors will be in alphabetical order and more details are available.</p>

    <p class="ocrs-activity">You will sometimes encounter activity instructions - they will look like this. Just follow the task provided and then move on to the next section or lesson.</p>

    <h3>Release schedule</h3>

    <p>New modules will be released every two weeks, however you have lifetime access to the material, so feel free to study at your own pace.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>January 1st | Module 1: Definitions</li>

<h1>Module 1: Definitions</h1>
<hr>

<div class="ocrs-content">
    <h1>What do we mean when we talk about religion?</h1>
    <hr>

    <div class="ideabox">
        <h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We need a definition of what religion is before we start studying it, but...</li>
            <li>How we <em>look</em> at religion plays a big role in defining what we think is religious.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>The first step in the study of any subject is to define our terms, draw a line around the area we're interested in, and decide how we'll investigate.</p>

    <p>Just like any other subject, the method of investigation will influence the type of results we achieve.</p>

    <p>To borrow a metaphor from the world of science: if we use a telescope, we only see things that are large and far away; if we use a microscope, we only see things that are small and close.</p>

    <p>If we only ever use <em>one</em> of these tools, we'll miss everything else and get a warped picture of the world. Have you ever tried walking down the street looking down a telescope? You'll walk into a lamppost.</p>

    <p>Getting back to religious studies, we find that the telescope/microscope principle is amplified by the fact that the subject matter is so broad, so deeply embedded in different human activities and intellectual domains that we can't limit ourselves to just one or two techniques. There are <em>a lot</em> of ways to investigate, and for that reason religious studies is sometimes called <strong>multidisciplinary</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Multidisciplinary: many ways to study</h3>

    <p>Multidisciplinary just means that scholars from different academic backgrounds can get involved and provide different (equally valid) perspectives. A historian will have different ideas and observations to a philosopher, who in turn will work differently to an anthropologist, and they will have different skills to a sociologist!</p>

    <p>Since all of these disciplines (or ways of study) focus on different areas of human life and activity, using different methods, and drawing different conclusions, it's <em>especially</em> important to make sure we understand what religion is before we start.</p>

    <p>But... if we start with a preconceived idea of what <strong>religion</strong> is, won't we just pick the methods that work for our preconception and ignore the other material that might be relevant?</p>

    <p>Yes. Unfortunately, religious studies can be a bit tricky!</p>

    <p>As we go forward, we'll try to unpick some of this complexity and you should emerge with a better understanding of what religion is, what it isn't, and the relationship between scholar and subject.</p>
</div>

<div class="ocrs-content">
   	<h1>How would you define religion?</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>Now that I've suggested our definitions might be problematic, I'd like you to take a moment and think about how you, personally, would define religion to someone who had never heard about it before.</p>

	<p class="ocrs-activity">What is religion? What sorts of activities are religious? Does religion exist to serve a purpose? If so, is that purpose individual or collective? How would you recognise religion?<br><br>You can share your ideas in the discussion area if you'd like to see what other people think.</p>
</div>

<div class="ocrs-content">
    <h1>Discussion</h1>
    <hr>
    
	<div class="ideabox">
		<h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There are lots of possible definitions, none of them are 100% right.</li>
			<li>We can't tell which religion (if any) is true, we can just look at what people say and do.</li>
			<li>Religious activity can be grouped into belief, practice, and community to make it easier to study.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>There are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers to this question, and your responses may have covered many different areas, but here are some of the ideas I came up with.</p>

	<p>Religion&hellip;</p>

	<p>&hellip;is a way of relating to the world and finding one's place</p>

	<p>&hellip;helps people to feel secure and safe</p>

	<p>&hellip;provides meaning and direction</p>

	<p>&hellip;is a tool for controlling large groups of people</p>

	<p>&hellip;is a personal method of self-improvement</p>

	<p>&hellip;guides people towards the divine</p>

	<p>&hellip;is a way to bring people together</p>

	<p>You may have noticed that my definitions were of a fairly sympathetic character. In contrast, there are many perspectives on religion that would classify it as untrue stories, methods of manipulation, and social power structures. You may find yourself leaning in that direction, finding religion to be somewhat oppressive or socially regressive &ndash; this is valid too, and there's plenty of evidence for it.</p>

	<p>You may also have noticed that my responses were non-denominational, in other words, not restricted to the perspective of one particular tradition or religious group. This is something that we should all aim for in religious studies &ndash; an understanding of human religiosity that is not restricted to one particular ideology or tradition.</p>

	<p>To put it another way, if we get all of our information about what it means to be religious from Christian sources, then we might end up with a view of religion that leans very heavily towards religious systems of salvation, with holy scripture and organised structures of worship, and we'd miss out on all the other expressions of religious activity that don't look enough like Christianity to count.</p>

	<p>As it happens, this is <em>exactly</em> what happened to the field of religious studies for a long time - it was based on an idea of religion that was modelled on Christianity, and it <em>did</em> exclude many other traditions on the basis that they didn't look enough like Christianity to count.</p>

	<h3>What we can actually study</h3>

	<p>When it comes to the study of religion, it might be tempting to think that we'll be trying to figure out whether God is real, what is the nature of the soul, or whether good and evil are absolute. You know, the big questions about life.</p>

	<p>But remember, we're aiming for an academic investigation of the <em>observable facts</em>. The question of whether a religion is more or less <em>true&nbsp;</em>lies well outside our capacity as academic observers to determine. As scholars of religious studies, we're interested in the <em>measurable data of human life</em>, things we can smell, touch, taste, see, and hear.</p>

	<p>Sure, it's possible that only one religion has the inside scoop on reality &ndash; but that's not something we can reliably test or demonstrate. The 'sister subject' to religious studies is theology (study of the divine) and this is typically where you would go to engage personally, morally, and intellectually with the ideas and practices of different religions. There are plenty of theologians who also practice religious studies, and there are religious studies scholars who have thoughts and feelings about their personal relationship to the universe. What's important to recognise is that the two fields of study approach different things in different ways.</p>

	<p>As religious studies scholars, we will look at the <strong>human</strong> activities typically associated with religion and spirituality. Broadly, we can group these under three headings: belief, practice, and community. These are the same categories that the sociologist <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim">Emile Durkheim</a> identified in <em>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</em> (emphasis added below).</p>

	<blockquote>
        <em>A religion is a unified system of <strong>beliefs</strong> and <strong>practices</strong> relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden&mdash;beliefs and practices which unite in one single moral <strong>community</strong> called a Church, all those who adhere to them.</em>
		<br>
        <br>Durkheim (1995, p.44)
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the next few units, we'll explore each of these aspects in more detail.</p>
    
    <p class="ocrs-activity">Note that Durkheim speaks in a universalist tone (i.e. he's trying to provide a definition of religion that can be applied in any setting), but uses explicitly Christian language ('one single moral community called a Church').<br><br>Why do you think this is?</p>
    
    <p class="ocrs-activity">Durkheim also defines a key concept (sacred things) as 'things set apart and forbidden'.<br><br>Do you think this is a suitable definition of the sacred? What does the word mean to you? Does Durkheim's definition leave room for an unseen reality, or is he claiming that the sacred is purely a human convention?</p>

    <h1>Belief</h1>
    <hr>

    <div class="ideabox">
        <h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Religious systems often include beliefs about the world (both seen and unseen).</li>
            <li>Religious scripture encourages personal experience to provide evidence.</li>
            <li>Subscribing to a set of beliefs (orthodoxy) is not always essential for belonging to a religion.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>One of the most prominent and well-known aspects of religion in the Western world is <strong>faith</strong>. This term often comes with a variety of associated meanings and implications, but at its root we can say that faith involves <em>belief in a set of doctrines or creeds which provide meaning and direction, often in the absence of empirical evidence.</em></p>

    <p>Since the relationship between religious belief and scientific empiricism has often been contentious, it's worthwhile looking a little more closely at how people believe in things, and what this means.</p>

    <p>There are different types of belief, and not all of them are considered religious; for example, very few of us have examined cells under microscopes, but we are all (I think!) happy to accept the idea that humans are composed of vast colonies of cellular creatures working in chemical harmony. Exceptionally few have been into space, but the image of the world as a floating globe orbiting a fiery nuclear reactor is almost universally taken as fact.</p>

    <p>In fact, almost all of the scientific knowledge that is presented to school children, readers of popular science books, and the average person who takes an interest in such matters, is taken purely on faith. Most people simply don't have the means, skill, or inclination to personally verify all of the claims they would need to 'fact check' everything they are told. This faith is placed in the educational establishment, scientific community, and social authority &ndash; in other words, in people.</p>

    <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with this approach to gaining knowledge about the world, and there are many checks and balances built into the scientific process to help reduce the ingress of error and personal bias, but it does present an interesting parallel to religious belief. Religious belief is often presented in such a way that it <em>cannot&nbsp;</em>be experimentally verified &ndash; even if we had all the resources of a modern university. A good example is the belief that Jesus was the son of God, and that he's capable of granting spiritual salvation. There is no DNA test that can prove this claim, and no scientific way to test that someone's soul has been saved (or indeed that one's soul exists at all). However, this is not entirely true.</p>

    <p>Many religions encourage prospective adherents to test their claims through spiritual activities such as the reading of scripture, meditation, or other activities which encourage a religious mindset. For example, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (also known as the Mormons) sometimes refer to a passage in the Book of Mormon that instructs individuals to ask God whether the text is true to help resolve any doubts.</p>

    <blockquote>
        And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
        <br>
        <br><a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.4" target="_BLANK">The Book of Moroni 10.4, Book of Mormon</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We find a similar claim in the Qur'an, which argues that its quality as scripture proves its authenticity, but challenges anyone to produce a work of comparable quality in order to refute it.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Or do they say [about the Prophet], &quot;He invented it?&quot; Say, &quot;Then bring forth a surah like it and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful.&quot;
        <br>
        <br><a href="https://quran.com/10/38" target="_BLANK">Qur'an 10.38</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the Qur'an, each chapter is called a <em>surah</em>, so the verse here is arguing quite strongly that no one could create something equal to just a small portion of the Qur'an, even if they had help.</p>

    <p>In the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu text which takes the form of a conversation between the god Krishna and his devotee Arjuna, Krishna outright states that experience will resolve the doubts that come from reading different scriptures, with different ideas and values.</p>

    <blockquote>
        When thy mind leaves behind its dark forest of delusion, thou shalt go beyond the scriptures of times past and still to come.
        <br>
        <br>When thy mind, that may be wavering in the contradictions of many scriptures, shall rest unshaken in divine contemplation, then the goal of Yoga is thine.
        <br>
        <br>Bhagavad Gita 2.52-3 (trans. Mascaro)
    </blockquote>

    <p>And in the Sikh holy book, itself revered as a Guru, we find these comments originally composed by Guru Arjan:</p>

    <blockquote>
        With one-pointed mind, meditate on the One Lord, and the doubts of your mind will be dispelled.
        <br>
        <br>Sri Guru Granth Sahib p. 47 (trans. Khalsa)
    </blockquote>

    <p>So, unlike scientific belief, which rests on evidence that can be tested publicly and repeatedly, religious belief tends to involve evidence that is personal, subjective, and unique to one moment in time &ndash; for example a response to a prayer or a moment of spiritual enlightenment.</p>

    <p>This absence of scientific evidence does not necessary invalidate the truth claims made by religious traditions, but does change the nature of the relationship between the religious adherent and the truth, purpose, and beauty of their beliefs.</p>

    <p>For example, some historians question whether Jesus (whether man or deity) actually existed, since the Gospels were written long after his death, and there are barely any independent references to him from the period in which he lived. Yet, despite this lack of strong material evidence, many millions of people across the world believe in the reality of Jesus, and his life as described in the New Testament; in fact, this belief has become so central to Christianity that it is difficult to define someone as Christian if they don't believe it, and it's part of one of the earliest formulations of the Christian religion: the Apostles' Creed:</p>

    <blockquote>
        I believe in God, the Father almighty,
        <br>maker of heaven and earth;
        <br>And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord;
        <br>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
        <br>born of the Virgin Mary,
        <br>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
        <br>was crucified, dead, and buried.
        <br>He descended into hell.
        <br>
        <br>The third day he rose again from the dead.
        <br>He ascended into heaven,
        <br>and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty.
        <br>From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
        <br>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
        <br>the holy catholic Church,
        <br>the communion of saints,
        <br>the forgiveness of sins,
        <br>the resurrection of the body,
        <br>and the life everlasting. Amen.
        <br>
        <br><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed_(TEC_BCP_I)" target="_BLANK">The Apostles' Creed</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Some atheists and agnostics, who struggle with the the relationship between religious belief and empirical evidence, but who nonetheless were raised in a predominantly Christian culture and identify with some elements of the tradition, prefer to call themselves 'cultural Christians' &ndash; see for example <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-take-christ-out-of-christianity/2015/05/01/a4e28430-eebc-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html" target="_BLANK">Alana Massey's discussion on this</a> and <a href="https://religionnews.com/2015/05/11/can-christian-without-believing-christ-commentary/" target="_BLANK">Trevin Wax's commentary</a> for a Christian perspective.</p>

    <p>There is a technical word for describing the way that some people insist on believing the 'right' things. <strong>Orthodoxy:&nbsp;</strong><em>strict adherence to a set of beliefs and principles</em>.</p>

    <p>Just like we found with 'belief', orthodoxy can also be used in non-religious contexts, wherever individuals are expected to follow a particular way of thinking or believing. For example, scientific orthodoxy is sometimes used to describe the way that certain ideas are so central to a scientific worldview that they should not be questioned &ndash; like the spherical nature of the planet, or <a href="http://americanscience.blogspot.com/2014/04/scientific-orthodoxy-mary-jane.html" target="_BLANK">the absence of deities in the creation of the universe</a>.</p>

    <p>Due to the historical influence of Christianity in western nations, and the importance of orthodox belief structures to Christianity's success, there is a firm link between the idea of belief and the idea of religion in a western setting. Therefore, it's often a normal line of enquiry when learning about an unfamiliar religious tradition to ask 'what do they believe?'</p>

    <p>However, belief was not always so central. In her TED talk, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/karen_armstrong_makes_her_ted_prize_wish_the_charter_for_compassion" target="_BLANK">My Wish: The Charter for Compassion</a>, author Karen Armstrong makes the point that prior to the 17th Century, the meaning of belief, and the significance it held in religious circles, was much different. It meant only to hold dear, or to prize, and the sense that people should hold a particular set of ideas about reality was not an enforced standard, as it later came to be.</p>

    <p>It's not just pre-modern Christianity that has a more relaxed approach to belief; in many modern religious traditions it's not seen as important to subscribe to a specific set of ideas, but it often <strong>is</strong> important to engage in ritual practices or affirm identity with the community. Scholars have historically looked for ways to define religion according to 'belief' for the same reasons they have looked for books of religious law and ignored oral traditions, material culture, and lived experience &ndash; i.e. they represent a western understanding of Christian-centric religion as it was around the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century when the science of religious studies was developing.</p>

    <p>Though these belief-focused approaches are no longer common, they have nonetheless left a mark on the subject in the wider culture, and people may often think of a religion in terms such as Buddhists believe X rather than Buddhists do Y, or feel Z. It's not that belief isn't important, it's just that it's not the whole story.</p>

    <h1>Case study: Islam: the Six Articles of Faith</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>We're now going to look at an example of how religious belief &ndash; or faith &ndash; is used to shape and define a community of believers.</p>

    <p>Within Islam, a large and diverse group of religious traditions, there are three aspects which are generally agreed upon &ndash; these are <em>islam&nbsp;</em>(submission)<em>, iman&nbsp;</em>(faith)<em>,&nbsp;</em>and <em>ihsan&nbsp;</em>(perfection)<em>.&nbsp;</em>Naturally, we're going to focus on <em>iman&nbsp;</em>and see how it is understood in relation to Islam as a religious tradition, but it's clear from this threefold division that faith by itself isn't the whole story.</p>

    <p><em>Iman&nbsp;</em>is composed of six items, which Muslims are expected to believe in order to live a devout life:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Allah &ndash; the existence of one god, who alone created and sustains the universe</li>
        <li>Angels &ndash; messengers of Allah who can communicate with humanity</li>
        <li>Holy Books &ndash; the scriptures, including the Qur'an but also elements of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and the message preached by Isa (Jesus)</li>
        <li>Prophets &ndash; the messengers and prophets of Allah who came before Muhammad</li>
        <li>Day of Judgement &ndash; a day on which Allah will assess the character of each person and either send them to heaven or hell</li>
        <li>Predestination &ndash; Allah knows everything that will happen, although the common view is that humans still have free will to make choices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>References to these six articles of faith are frequently made in Islamic publications &ndash; for example, take a look at this information page from the Enfield Islamic Centre's website and see if you can find where the articles are mentioned: <a href="http://www.enfieldislamiccentre.org.uk/about-islam" target="_blank">http://www.enfieldislamiccentre.org.uk/about-islam</a></p>

    <p>The origin of these six beliefs go back to an event recorded in the <em>ahadith &ndash;</em> these texts are reported stories about Muhammad, and are frequently used to fill in details about the life of the prophet, and also to provide guidance on points not directly addressed by the Qur'an.</p>

    <p>There are two <em>ahadith&nbsp;</em>in particular which describe an encounter between Muhammad and the angel Jibril (Gabriel). During this encounter, the angel asks for an explanation of the three different aspects of Islam (islam, iman, ihsan), and this is where the six articles of faith are clearly laid out.</p>

    <p>You can read these ahadith online using the links below:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/1" target="_blank">https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/1</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/43" target="_blank">https://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/43</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, in some cases, following these beliefs &ndash; even if in accordance with <em>islam&nbsp;</em>and <em>ihsan</em> &ndash; can lead to issues if <em>other</em> beliefs or practices contradict established Islamic traditions.</p>

    <p>We can see an example of this in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the UK. This group follows the same articles of faith as the rest of the Islamic world, but <em>also</em> believes that a man called Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who lived during the late 1800's and early 1900's, was the prophesied return of the Messiah (i.e. saviour) and Mahdi (redeemer of Islam). Whilst this idea of a redeeming figure is a generally accepted belief in mainstream Islam, this <em>specific&nbsp;</em>individual was not acknowledged by the vast majority of Muslims.</p>

    <p class="ocrs-activity">To see this division in a real world context, take a moment now to read <a href="http://www.loveforallhatredfornone.org/the-muslim-council-of-britain-has-officially-decided-im-not-islamic-enough-but-i-never-did-anything-wrong/" target="_blank">this account written by Waqar Ahmedi</a>, who is speaking from an Ahmadi perspective, discussing his experiences with the Muslim Council of Britain.</p>

    <p class="ocrs-activity">Now compare this to the official position of the Muslim Council of Britain (published shortly before Ahmedi's piece) and see whether there are any interesting points regarding belief, specifically the six articles of faith, and where there might be points of disagreement: <a href="https://mcb.org.uk/mcb-updates/position-statement-the-muslim-council-of-britain-and-ahmadis/" target="_top">https://mcb.org.uk/mcb-updates/position-statement-the-muslim-council-of-britain-and-ahmadis/</a></p>

    <p>As you can see, the critical issue here is the finality of Muhammad as the last prophet, however the Ahmadis do not technically refer to their founder as a prophet &ndash; instead he is only ever called the Messiah and Mahdi.</p>
        
    <p class="ocrs-activity">Why do you think this distinction still does not satisfy the conditions of the MCB?</p>

    <h1>Practice</h1>

	<div class="ideabox">
		<h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Religious systems are built on behaviour and activity, not just beliefs.</li>
			<li>Sometimes practice is more important than belief.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>Religious practices are those behaviours and actions that have religious meaning for those who perform them; there are many different types and examples of such practices, including pilgrimage to holy sites (such as the tomb of Imam Husayn for Shi'ite Muslims), prayer, and song &ndash; to name a few.</p>

	<p>As we've seen from the previous units, belief is only one element of religious life. Practical action is just as important, and in fact orthodoxy, or 'right belief', is sometimes contrasted with ortho<em>praxy&nbsp;</em>or 'right practice' as a way to describe this importance.</p>

	<p>For some religious traditions, it's more important that adherents do certain things, in certain ways, and it's less important what they think or believe. We often find this in Buddhist traditions, where the focus is placed on how to live without suffering (or at least, with less suffering). This approach is codified in the Eightfold Path, eight principles which help to direct behaviour and practice.</p>

	<blockquote>
        <strong>The Noble Eightfold Path</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Right understanding (Samma ditthi)</li>
			<li>Right thought (Samma sankappa)</li>
			<li>Right speech (Samma vaca)</li>
			<li>Right action (Samma kammanta)</li>
			<li>Right livelihood (Samma ajiva)</li>
			<li>Right effort (Samma vayama)</li>
			<li>Right mindfulness (Samma sati)</li>
			<li>Right concentration (Samma samadhi)</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/noble-eightfold-path/" target="_blank">Tricycle Magazine</a>
    </blockquote>

	<p>We can see a real world example of this attitude at Dhamma Dipa, a Vipassana meditation centre in Herefordshire, UK. Here, individuals who attend retreats are expected to engage with a technique of meditation and self-awareness, without being asked to subscribe to any metaphysical ideas or religious beliefs.</p>

	<blockquote>
        <strong>Do I have to be a Buddhist to practice Vipassana?</strong>
		<br>People from many religions and no religion have found the meditation course helpful and beneficial. Vipassana is an art of living, a way of life. While it is the essence of what the Buddha taught, it is not a religion; rather, it is the cultivation of human values leading to a life which is good for oneself and good for others.
		<br>
        <br><a href="https://www.uk.dhamma.org/about-vipassana/faqs/#c150" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions | Vipassana Meditation UK</a>
    </blockquote>

	<p>Vipassana is a type of Buddhist meditation, and like some schools of Buddhism, does not require adherents to worship in or believe in a deity or indeed any supernatural phenomena in order to benefit from the practice.</p>

    <p>It's worth noting, since we're talking about Buddhism &ndash; specifically Buddhism in the West &ndash; that not all Buddhist traditions are atheistic and contemplative, and there are plenty of traditions which involve the worship of supernatural figures. Amit&#x101;bha, for example, is a celestial Buddha who achieved enlightenment and created a divine paradise called his pure land, which can be reached after death by anyone who chants Amit&#x101;bha's name &ndash; this branch of Buddhism is often called Pure Land Buddhism, or sometimes Amidism.</p>
    
    <p>In the next lesson, we'll look at why some religious practices are considered to be rituals, and what this designation really means.</p>

<div class="ocrs-content">
    <h1>Ritual</h1>
	<hr>

    <div class="ideabox">
		<h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Some religious practices have specific rules about how they are performed, these practices are sometimes called rituals.</li>
			<li>There is no hard line between 'religious practice' and 'ritual', but practices with more rules can be described as more ritualistic.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>Religious practices might be described as rituals, a term that carries many conflicting associations; however, it's possible to see ritual as a <em>type</em> of religious practice, which pays attention to not only what is done, but also the broader context in which the action is situated. In other words, rituals are religious practices with some degree of specificity that separates them from 'everyday' religious activities.</p>

	<p>This definition finds common ground with a dictionary definition, which describes ritual as '[a] religious or solemn ceremony consisting of a series of actions performed according to a prescribed order' (Oxford University Press, 2018). This sense of ritual as a mechanism of order and control recurs in a variety of contexts, but we should be wary of making things too simple; Catherine Bell (2006) points out that '...scholars may be at the point of relinquishing the idea that there can be a single theory of ritual, for ritual may not be any one thing.'</p>

	<p>We can start to appreciate the differences between ritual and non-ritual religious practices by considering <strong>diet</strong>. For many people, choosing what food to eat is a decision based on their religious culture and beliefs, but isn't actually a ritual.</p>

	<p>Jewish dietary law (<em>kashrut</em>), requires that only foods of appropriate types can be consumed; these appropriate foods are described as <em>kosher</em>, suitable for consumption. However, the decision to eat (or not) in accordance with kashrut doesn't appear to be ritualistic; it isn't ceremonial, and although the prescribed foods suggest a sense of order, kashrut doesn't dictate where, when, or how a meal is eaten.</p>

	<p>By contrast, the slaughter of animals for consumption <em>could</em> be described as a ritual because it involves a deliberate action by an authorised person (in the case of Jewish slaughter, this person is called a <em>shochet</em>) with prescribed methods, intentions, and outcomes. In Judaism, this ritual slaughter is known as <em>shechita</em>, although the British organisation Shechita UK doesn't consider the act a ritual, and instead describes the process in medical terms, focusing on the claimed humaneness of the method. You can read their comments here: <a href="http://shechitauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A_Guide_to_Shechita_2009__01.pdf" target="_blank">http://shechitauk.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/A_Guide_to_Shechita_2009__01.pdf</a></p>

	<p>An interesting overlap between ritual and non-ritual practice is found in the act of eating. Making the opening remarks at the Shoresh Food Conference (a Jewish event), Risa Alyson Cooper questions whether it's enough for Jews to eat kosher foods, or whether they should introduce additional (ritual) behaviour: 'Does eating Jewishly mean creating space for the divine at our tables? Does it mean acknowledging the role of an ultimate Creator, an [sic] unifying energy or breath of life? &nbsp;Does it mean saying a blessing, expressions of gratitude?'. You can read the remarks in full here: <a href="http://shoresh.ca/shoresh-food-conference-opening-remarks-or-inspiration-move-me-brightly/" target="_blank">http://shoresh.ca/shoresh-food-conference-opening-remarks-or-inspiration-move-me-brightly/</a></p>

	<p>The activities that Cooper describes (creating space for, and acknowledging, the divine) would shift the act of eating further into the realm of ritual, creating a more deliberate approach to consumption, a better sense of order, and clearer outcomes (appreciation and gratitude among the eaters).</p>

	<p>This exploration also hints that the boundary between ritual and non-ritual may be permeable &ndash; in other words actions might move between ritual and non-ritual depending on a variety of factors including what the action is, why it's performed, how it's done, where, when, and with whom. Every aspect of a practice can influence how that practice is experienced and perceived, and create boundaries in the social and emotional lives of religious practitioners.</p>

	<p class="ocrs-activity">Watch the video below, which features a talk on ritual delivered by Dimitris Xygalatas - pay attention to what he suggests about the function of ritual, and the form it usually takes.</p>

	<p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrjCLvSQ_cw" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span></p>

	<p>Boundaries, and their utility, according to Dimitris Xygalatas, form the basis of ritual; rituals create a sense of order which contrasts with the more common experience of disorder. He notes that rituals can function as methods of mitigating the stress that comes with uncertainty: 'We see that the more stressed [experimental participants] get, the more repetitive, rigid, and redundant their hand movements become; in other words, the more stressed they get, the more ritualised their behaviour'.</p>

	<p>The sense that ritual involves formalism (strict rules about behaviour) is found across a variety of religious contexts, but is ritual behaviour just rigid and repetitive? In the next lesson we'll take a closer look.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Let's look at the high energy environment of African Neo-Pentecostal Christian churches, for example the Cherubim and Seraphim church of Nigeria.</p>

	<p>You can see an example of the C&amp;S church activity in the video below:</p>

	<p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ScmkgYNgnQE" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span></p>

	<p>The church rituals involve physical activity such as clapping, kicking, dancing, and singing, and each has its own meaning and purpose. For instance, kicking symbolises spiritual power and helps to manifest it for the adherent, clapping symbolises victory, and singing symbolises joy (Harris, 2006, p.194).</p>

	<p>One of the tenets of C&amp;S churches (and Pentecostalism more generally) is that people are moved by the power of the Holy Spirit (one of the three Christian aspects of God), and these ecstatic expressions (dancing, clapping, etc.) aren't <em>specifically</em> premeditated, but there's nonetheless an expectation that spontaneous movements can take place within the context of worship, and so they too form part of the ritual.</p>

	<p>The highly charged, spontaneous ritual activity found in Neo-Pentecostalism seems to disagree with how Xygalatas talks about ritual as an activity characterised by repetition and rigidity.</p>

	<p>The religion and ritual studies scholar Catherine Bell (2006) suggests that, in part, the modern understanding of ritual as something unthinkingly repeated and detached from authentic engagement with the world has been inherited from Western Protestant attitudes towards the Catholic church, and notes that this bias should be carefully negotiated.</p>

	<blockquote>
        Among the many attitudes towards ritual in the history of religion is the Protestant distrust of rites. That distrust is taken the furthest by groups like the Quakers, who shun any kind of orchestrated activity. Even today, a self-consciously &quot;modern&quot; attitude tends to equate a full ritual system with a &quot;primitive&quot; form of religiosity. This cultural continuation of a Protestant aversion to ritual tends to equate heavily ritualized practices with Catholic excesses and with the Catholic corruption of a prior, pristine period. These inconsistent assessments of ritual - ritual as a merely primitive activity versus ritual as excessively priestly pomp - avoided expose by being applied to different religions in different parts of the world. Hence primitive religion was to be found in illiterate Africa and corrupted Buddhism in literate Asia. Despite sensitivity to these tendencies, some argue that there remain subtle biases. &quot;Ritualistic&quot; still connotes thoughtless and dogmatic.
		<br>
        <br>Bell, 2006, p. 399
    </blockquote>

    <p>What Bell is saying is that not only is our modern understanding of ritual based on historic distrust, but that the justification for the distrust changes depending on the circumstances.</p>
    
    <p>If the rituals are committed by a large organisation (like the Catholic Church), then they are examples of religion that has grown too large, become too formal and stiff. This criticism wouldn't work in a pre-literate society, for example a remote tribe living in the wilderness, so instead the justification is that ritual is simplistic and primitive - religion in its infancy, superstition.</p>

    <p>As Bell points out, even after we attempt to correct for these inherited ideas about ritual, very often negative bias still exists - if not within ourselves then certainly within the wider society and culture.</p>

	<p>Some religious groups that have transitioned into a Western context show an awareness of this bias and try to make it work in their favour, for instance the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, a Hindu order originally from India with temples in the UK, takes care to assert that <em>their</em> rituals '&hellip;are not rooted in blind faith or superstition; rather, they have a practical application and relevance to people's everyday lives' (<a href="https://www.baps.org/About-BAPS/WhoWeAre/BasicBeliefs/ThePhilosophy/HinduPracticesandRituals.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.baps.org/About-BAPS/WhoWeAre/BasicBeliefs/ThePhilosophy/HinduPracticesandRituals.aspx</a>).</p>

        <h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ritual may help to create or sustain a sense of order.</li>
            <li>Sometimes ritual behaviour can develop organically, without any intention - the meaning and order come later.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Whether ritual is understood as rigid or flexible, the idea that it generates and sustains order is reinforced by the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Douglas" target="_blank">Mary Douglas</a>.</p>

    <p>Using dietary restrictions as an example, Douglas explored how an experience of order is built out of distinctions such as purity and pollution, often based on seemingly superficial assessments; her explanation of the dietary rules expressed in the Jewish scripture, for example, is that within the cultural context of early Judaism, sheep were the 'normal' animal for food. Animals were therefore assessed based on how closely they matched this standard &ndash; pigs did not match very closely at all, and were therefore excluded from the diet. These sorts of social categories provide the context within which the ritual operates, and explain how it produces and sustains a sense of order.</p>

    <p>Returning to the Cherubim and Seraphim church, there are many elements of C&amp;S worship that help to reinforce the ritual distinction between chaos and order, such as white garments (symbolising purity), removal of shoes in places of prayer (preventing pollution), and prohibitions against menstruating women (the power of bodily fluids plays into Douglas's ideas about things being in their appropriate place &ndash; bodily fluids 'belong' in the body).</p>

    <p>This interpretation of ritual as a method of establishing (or re-establishing) order finds common ground with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_W._G._Horton" target="_BLANK">Robin Horton</a>, who suggests that rituals are methods of controlling the environment; this is a <strong>functional</strong> theory of why ritual arises, i.e. ritual serves a function and should be understood in that light.</p>

    <p>Horton claims that the views and beliefs that underlie ritual activities arise as a way to understand what the world is, and why it behaves the way that it does. This functional approach suggests that ritual is an intentional action, which makes use of relationships between phenomena as understood by a religious group; the restrictions on how and by whom a ritual is conducted make sense when considered within this framework.</p>

    <p>In other words, ritual is a kind of science, where actions are believed to have specific outcomes, and so are used when the outcome is needed. If some people or things invalidate the outcome, they must be prevented from performing the ritual (leading to ideas of purity and pollution).</p>

    <p>Where this approach may fail to explain ritual is situations where rituals emerge <em>without</em> premeditated purpose or even a framework of established rules about what ritual leads to what outcome. An excellent example of this sort of naturally occurring ritual is provided by Ronald Grimes (2011), who describes establishing a ritual practice with his students that he intentionally does not explain. He hands out a small wooden egg-shaped object repeatedly throughout his classes, and even takes the 'egg' on field trips with the students.</p>

    <p>In the absence of a provided meaning or intention, ritual behaviour nonetheless developed through the repetition of an activity (handling and discussing a wooden 'egg'). Grimes observed that meaning was independently developed by the participants, who, having grown attached to the object and the ritual, didn't want to throw the 'egg' away at the end of the year, and instead suggested repeating the process with the next group of students as a way of establishing a link between them all.</p>

    <p>Clearly, though ritual is often repetitious to the point of formalism, it doesn't need be as tightly regimented as the liturgical rites of a church to qualify; by the same token, Horton's functionalism (i.e. a ritual's intentional, purposive aspect) might come <em>after&nbsp;</em>a ritual has developed, rather than being a pre-requisite.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, rituals often do fulfil many functions, one of which is to record events and experiences across time and space; the performance of ritual provides a link between practitioners no matter where or when they exist.</p>
    
    <p>The Shi'ite Muslim rituals of <a href="https://www.ashura.com/" target="_blank">Ashura</a> both in Iraq and the wider world are a good example of ritual preserving memory; the ceremonial gatherings, or <em>majalis</em>, provide opportunities for communities to relive not just the narrative of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, but to embrace and embody the emotions first felt over a thousand years ago. You can watch a quick overview of Ashura in the video from Euronews below.</p>

    <p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsgsuPxat6A" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span></p>

    <p>Claims of antiquity can help to establish rituals as authentic by connecting participants to their history and ancestors, but maintaining a ritual over vast distances is just as important for members of dispersed communities. For example, the Hindu diaspora (Hindus who have left their homeland of India) can often find themselves in alien societies and cultures, so ritual acts, ranging from <em>nitya puja</em> (daily devotion) to the construction of a <em>mandir</em> (temple) and installation of <em>murtis</em> (divine statues), can all help to ensure a connection between adherents' original home and their new one.</p>

    <p>At its root, ritual seems to suggest that there are moments worth preserving because of their orienting power; these moments point towards order, even if that order comes from a sense of pain or despair. Since disorder can represent uncertainty and anxiety, people will tend to preserve moments of order by repeating, approximating, or re-enacting them.</p>
        
    <p>However, for all this talk about order and meaning, ritual is clearly not one single thing; Catherine Bell (2006) notes that in contemporary ritual studies '...the emphasis is on how people ritualize...' as opposed to looking for a universal definition (much like contemporary religious studies).</p>

    <p>If we were to hazard a provisional definition of ritual, we might say that ritual practice means taking care to perform an action in accordance with a formula that emerges from human engagement with disorder, either consciously or subconsciously, so that order might be preserved, generated, or utilised. It takes on many forms, and serves many emergent functions, but at its root involves a relationship between chaos and order that positions the human individual as mediator, and regulates its own development by tending towards conservatism.</p>

    <h3>The bigger picture</h3>
    <p>It's rarely the case that beliefs, principles, or ideas can be adopted without an accompanying practice, and likewise most practices will come packaged with (at least some) beliefs and concepts that are integral to its proper performance. In his article, <em>Behavior, Belonging, and Belief: A Theory of Ritual Practice,&nbsp;</em>Douglas Marshall states the importance of religious practice &ndash; and ritual in particular &ndash; in strong terms, placing it prior to the emergence of belief.</p>

    <blockquote>
        The practice of ritual produces two primary outcomes &ndash; <em>Belief&nbsp;</em>and <em>Belonging</em> &hellip; That rituals play a part in the production of this belief is suggested both by their noted capacity to resolve paradox and inconsistency and by their timing, occurring as they do in the wake of epistemically threatening events such as death, defeat, and aberration.
        <br>
        <br>Marshall, 2002
    </blockquote>

    <p>We'll come back later to explore Marshall's comments about 'belonging', but what he is saying here is that rituals help to provide order and meaning, particularly in the face of catastrophic events like the death of a loved one, and are often the <em>first&nbsp;</em>thing done in response to such challenges.</p>

    <p>Clearly, not every religion can be summed up by asking 'what do they believe?' any more than you can sum them up by asking 'what do they do?'. What's important is to consider both questions, and place the information in its correct cultural context.</p>

    <h1>Case study: murti puja</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>We'll turn briefly now to look at a real world example of religious practice, which involves ritual behaviour: <em>murti puja</em>.</p>

	<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/126155/images/aea/f40/c75/hanuman-3817783_640.jpg" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p>

	<p>This practice is found primarily within Hindu religious traditions, and involves the worship of representations of gods both in the temple and the home. Unlike, however, statues of Jesus in a Christian church, <em>murtis</em> are believed to be places of residence for the gods, who are installed in the murti during a ceremony (known as the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prana_Pratishtha" target="_blank">prana pratishtha&nbsp;</a></em>), and thereafter treated exactly the same as the deity would be treated, including feeding, bathing, and dressing them.</p>

	<blockquote>
        A murti becomes venerable for Hindus only after it is enlivened with the spiritual energy and essence of the Deity. Because it contains the living presence of the Deity, a murti is more than a physical representation or a meditational tool. And so devout Hindus can see beyond the stone or metal or paint, and endeavour to relate to and serve the divine spirit within.
		<br>
        <br><a href="http://londonmandir.baps.org/worship/murti-puja-image-worship-in-hinduism/" target="_blank">http://londonmandir.baps.org/worship/murti-puja-image-worship-in-hinduism/</a>
    </blockquote>

	<p>It's important to note that the practitioners don't actually believe the murti <em>is&nbsp;</em>the deity, but that the deity resides <em>within&nbsp;</em>the murti &ndash; just as a hand is placed within a glove. Being supremely powerful, the same deity can reside within many murtis without being diminished, so there is no contradiction if another temple installs the same god or goddess (in fact, all Hindu deities are considered to be emanations of one single god).</p>

	<p>The use of murtis is not universal to all Hindu traditions, but the vast majority use them as a way to focus their spiritual attention. The form and deity, however, can vary considerably &ndash; there are millions of deities in the Hindu cosmos, and different geographic regions can often have ties to a particular goddess or god.</p>

	<p>Typical forms of worship with a murti include offerings of food, flowers, or incense. Devotees may also make an offering of light and song known as <em>aarti</em>, in which a flame or lamp is passed over and around the murti, along with prostrations and bowing.</p>

	<p>After worship, visitors to a murti will often undertake <em>pradakshina</em>, which means to circumambulate or walk around the murti in a clockwise direction, always keeping the deity to their right-hand side.</p>

	<blockquote>We always assume God is the center of our existence. He also exists everywhere. So when we do Pradakshina or circumambulation, we accept that our actions and thoughts are always centred around God. The center point is always fixed and remains the same at whatever distance we do the pradakshina. So we are reminded of the eternal truth that God is the center of gravity and the main focus of our existence. This is the main principle of Pradakshinam.

	<p>The puja, or worship, of the murti in a temple is typically overseen by one or several priests; they are responsible for washing, dressing, and feeding the deity, and generally treating it with great care and respect.</p>

	<blockquote>Priests are ritual specialists more than counsellors or pastors; they offer prayers to the deity on behalf of the devotee. The priests offer fruit, flowers, or coconut to the lord and then give back some of the blessed objects to the devotee to take home. The food thus presented is considered ennobled because it is now <em>pras&#x101;da&nbsp;</em>(literally &lsquo;clarity', but meaning &lsquo;divine favour'), a gift from the deity.

		<h2>The Big Ideas</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Community is a key part of all religious traditions.</li>
			<li>Religious communities often take responsibility for sharing their lifestyle and worldview with outsiders, or training new members.</li>
			<li>Communities who claim shared identity can still be subdivided based on personal religious practice, rank, or social position.</li>
			<li>Communities can be inward looking, or reach out to the wider world.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

    <p>As we noted previously in the quotes from Durkheim and Marhsall, not only does religion involve beliefs and practices, it also generally involves participation in a community, which provides a sense of belonging and identity for adherents.</p>
    
    <p>Community can take an institutional form, for instance membership in a church congregation, or it can be a sense of belonging to a less organised, wider group, like the Islamic <em>ummah&nbsp;</em>or community, which includes Muslims from all backgrounds, nations, and theological schools.</p>

	<blockquote>Muslims were commanded as their first duty to build a community (<em>ummah</em>) characterized by practical compassion, in which there was a fair distribution of wealth &hellip; The political and social welfare of the <em>ummah&nbsp;</em>would have sacramental value for Muslims. If the <em>ummah&nbsp;</em>prospered, it was a sign that Muslims were living according to God's will, and the experience of living in a truly <em>islamic&nbsp;</em>community, which made this existential surrender to the divine, would give Muslims intimations of sacred transcendence.
		<br>
		<br>Armstrong, 2001, pp. 5-6</blockquote>

	<p>According to Douglas Marshall, who we encountered earlier, it's the involvement in shared rituals and ceremonies that leads to a greater sense of community and bonding between participants &ndash; even if participants are only passively involved, just sharing that ceremonial space with others helps to form an enduring connection.</p>

	<p>This bond between people from diverse backgrounds, unified by a religious identity, can be found in many different traditions around the world. We see it in the common links between people of the Jewish faith, which has found political reality in the nation state of Israel; likewise most Buddhist traditions start their initiates with vows to take refuge / seek guidance in the so-called three jewels: Buddha, the Dhamma (i.e. the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (i.e. the community of practising Buddhists). This &lsquo;going for refuge' is described in the Dhammapada (a text containing sayings attributed to the Buddha, although written down after his death).</p>

	<blockquote>They go to many a refuge,
		<br>to mountains, forests,
		<br>parks, trees, and shrines:
		<br>people threatened with danger.
		<br>That's not the secure refuge,
		<br>that's not the supreme refuge,
		<br>that's not the refuge,
		<br>having gone to which,
		<br>you gain release
		<br>from all suffering and stress.
		<br>But when, having gone for refuge
		<br>to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha,
		<br>you see with right discernment
		<br>the four noble truths&mdash;
		<br>stress,
		<br>the cause of stress,
		<br>the transcending of stress,
		<br>and the noble eightfold path,
		<br>the way to the stilling of stress:
		<br>That's the secure refuge,
		<br>that, the supreme refuge,
		<br>that is the refuge,
		<br>having gone to which,
		<br>you gain release
		<br>from all suffering and stress.
		<br>
		<br>Dhammapada 188-192 (<a href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/books/Refuge/Section0002.html" target="_blank">trans. &#x1E6C;h&#x101;nissaro Bhikkhu</a>)</blockquote>

	<p>The Buddhist Sangha serves the dual purpose of providing refuge to the aspiring Buddhist, and preserving and communicating the Dhamma itself. According to tradition, it was the Buddha who placed this responsibly on the early monastic community, stating:</p>

	<blockquote>Go monks and travel for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare and happiness of gods and men. No two of you go the same way. Teach the Dhamma, monks &hellip; and proclaim the pure holy life. There are beings with little passion in their natures who are languishing for lack of hearing the Dhamma; they will understand it.
		<br>
		<br>Gombrich, 1988, pp.18-19</blockquote>

	<p>We find a similar instruction delivered by Jesus in the Book of Matthew, where he tells his disciples:</p>

	<blockquote>Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, proclaim this message: &lsquo;The kingdom of heaven has come near.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
		<br>
		<br>Matthew 10:5-8 (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A5-8&version=NIV" target="_blank">New International Version</a>)</blockquote>

	<p>Buddhism and its Sangha emerged from the Indian subcontinent, where we also find the development of Sikhi (also known as Sikhism), whose community of religious adherents use the related word <em><a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Sangat" target="_blank">sangat</a></em>.</p>

	<p>Sikhi is characterised by a series of ten divinely inspired leaders known as Gurus; unlike Hindu gurus (who tend to be considered holy persons with great wisdom), Sikh Gurus were viewed as conduits of the supreme guru (Waheguru) &ndash; i.e. God. Therefore the actions and sayings of the Gurus hold tremendous importance for the Sikhs, and during their lifetimes they were instrumental in shaping the tradition.</p>

	<p>The foundational relationship in Sikhi is between teacher and pupil, hence the importance of the term Guru (teacher) and Sikh (student). According to Sikhi, God is the supreme and immeasurable creator of all existence, which makes itself available to humanity in the form of a teacher who can dispel ignorance and darkness. Each successive human Guru presented this divine intelligence and guidance in different forms for different contexts, but the tenth and final Guru, Gobind Singh, placed spiritual authority in two complementary locations &ndash; the recorded scripture (known as<em>&nbsp;Guru Granth</em>) and the Sikh sangat itself, also referred to as the <em>Guru Panth&nbsp;</em>(panth means path, or way, and by extension &ndash; those who follow the Guru's way).</p>

	<p>The Sikh community can be further divided between those who have been initiated into a group known as the Khalsa (the pure), and those who follow the Gurus but don't engage in the additional practices required for Khalsa initiates. These additional steps involve a ceremony known as &lsquo;taking amrit' and the wearing of the so-called five K's.</p>

	<p>You can watch a discussion of this ceremony in the BBC clip below:</p>

    <p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIm7F0t8FrA" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span></p>
    
    <p>The ceremony is also covered in this video from the Open University.</p>

    <p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PhLer0OWtmk" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span></p>

	<p>There is sometimes dispute between whether the authority granted by Guru Gobind Singh applies to the entire Sikh panth, or specifically the Khalsa panth (Oxtoby, 1996, p.194). Whichever side of this debate is correct, religious authority wasn't <em>just</em> given to the Sikh community by itself, but also to the scriptures.</p>

	<blockquote>
        The leadership of the collective Khalsa or the Panth, did not mean that any majority decision taken by it had an automatic religious sanctity. The supreme consideration was that such decisions had to conform to the Sikh ideals &hellip; It was the Sikh principles which were to be supreme. The Guruship was conferred on Guru Granth Sahib [the holy text], and leadership on the collective Panth. These steps were taken to ensure that after the Gurus, the collective leadership of only those who were ideologically oriented, prevailed.
		<br>
        <br>Singh, 1997, p. 297
    </blockquote>

	<p>The amrit ceremony for Khalsa Sikhs is not the only example of initiation into religious communities, in fact it is a common practice in religious traditions around the world. Most Christian churches use a form of baptism, either anointing the head with holy water, or submerging the entire body, and new Muslims must recite the <em>shahada</em> or declaration of faith. These initiation practices help to establish a sense of the boundary between the old and the new identities, and link members together in a shared experience.</p>

	<p>Religious communities, especially if they require alternative lifestyles to the dominant culture they're situated within, can sometimes be inward-looking and closed-off from the outside world, and even loosely associated congregations can tend to focus on their own needs &ndash; but this is not always the case.</p>

	<p>Many religious communities make efforts to reach out to those around them, either to recruit new members, provide services, or engage in charity work. There are numerous examples of Christian aid organisations around the world, and Islamic charitable giving is a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/muslim-charity-charities-christmas-homelessness-volunteer-a8117116.html" target="_blank">major source of support</a> for many vulnerable groups. The All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims published a report on the extent of Islamic charity in the United Kingdom, called <em>Faith as the Fourth Emergency Service | British Muslim charitable contributions to the UK&nbsp;</em>which goes into this in more detail &ndash; if you are interested, you can read the report here: <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/599c3d2febbd1a90cffdd8a9/t/5ae09b288a922d758d2cd414/1524669250245/+Faith+as+the+Fourth+Emergency+Service+V3+Print.pdf" target="_blank">Faith as the Fourth Emergency Service</a>.</p>

	<p>In looking at religious charitable outreach, we'll now explore the practice of <em>langar</em> in Sikhi, and how this impacts both the Sikh sangat, and the wider community.</p>

    <h1>Case study: langar in the gurdwara</h1>
	<hr>

	<p>Within the Sikh religion, one of the important practical aspects is <em>seva&nbsp;</em>or selfless service, which takes the form of charitable actions.</p>

	<p>One of the primary barriers between Sikhs and God is <em>haumai</em> or self-centredness, which prevents the individual from realising their dependence on Waheguru. Seva therefore serves multiple purposes: helping those in the community, building charitable networks, and undermining any grandiose ideas of self-importance.</p>

	<p>One example of seva in practice is <em>langar</em>, a shared meal where all visitors to the Gurdwara eat together sitting on the floor, with no regard to hierarchy or background. The meal is a way to promote a sense of social equality, and also provides an opportunity for seva for those who donate, prepare, and serve the food.</p>

	<blockquote>
        The Gurus demanded through this common meal that all who came to them, Hindu or Muslim, Brahmin or Untouchable, Emperor or beggar, should lay aside their distinctions and become one in seeking the Guru&rsquo;s presence. The langar in Sikhism goes back to Guru Nanak, but the Third Guru [Guru Amar Das] emphasised it as a device for expressing the theoretical notion of equality in a practical way.
		<br>
        <br>Cole &amp; Sambhi, 1978, p. 22
    </blockquote>

	<p>We can see an example of the charitable spirit of seva and langar in the <a target="_BLANK" href="https://midlandlangarseva.org/">Midlands Langar Seva Society</a>, which was set up by Randhir Singh Heer to help provide food for the homeless. The charity operates across 17 cities in the UK, as well as using a converted bus to deliver hot meals (and a place to eat) wherever they&rsquo;re needed, and also provides langar in India, Thailand, and Germany.</p>

	<blockquote>
        &ldquo;Although the open kitchens provided by the Midlands Langar Seva Society have their roots in Sikh tradition, we support all and everyone in need of food,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Helping people is something which spans every culture and every tradition.&rdquo;

    </blockquote>

	<p>Rather than limiting their charitable activities to Sikhs, or even just visitors to the gurdwara, the MLSS reaches out to the broader community, forming links with the local population and providing support for those in need. We can see how this activity benefits those Sikhs involved by bringing them together in shared activity, and diminishing haumai, but we can also see that it strengthens the broader non-Sikh community by combating the dangers of homelessness with hot food and a safe place to eat and rest, and establishes strong links across religious boundaries.</p>

    <h1>Texts</h1>
	<hr>

    <div class="ideabox">
		<h2>The Big Ideas</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Texts are the transmission medium of human culture, not just religions.</li>
			<li>Texts aren&#39;t just written, they can take many forms.</li>
			<li>Texts carry meaning, but are also interpreted.</li>
			<li>The intended meaning of the authors isn&#39;t necessarily the meaning retrieved by the audience.</li>

		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>We have seen that religions are comprised of beliefs, practices, and sense of community, however all of these phenomena rely on transmission in order to survive &ndash; they must be communicated if they are to survive, and this is where religious texts come in.</p>

	<p>Although the word &lsquo;texts&rsquo; might imply a written document, the term has a wider scope in the field of religious studies. We can consider <strong>four</strong> categories of texts:</p>

	<p>1. <strong>Written documents.</strong> The most easily recognised form of text, for example the Bible or the Qur&rsquo;an. Though often considered &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; and unchanging, written texts are frequently altered and edited over long periods, and alternate versions of the same text are sometimes purged to create the image of uniformity.</p>

	<p>2. <strong>Oral traditions.</strong> These can be stories and songs that are preserved through verbal repetition and memory, and are performed for others to listen to or witness. Oral traditions, particularly those which can be written down, often migrate into written documents, for instance the Oral Torah is a Jewish religious text that was originally shared verbally before being codified.</p>

	<p>3. <strong>Artistic creations.</strong> It is also possible to view art, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional, as a kind of religious text. Artistic representations such as the paintings of Krishna commissioned by the Gaudiya Vaishnavite group ISKCON are a good example (http://www.krishnapath.org/art-gallery-home/art-gallery-of-krishna-and-his-devotees-transcendental-pastimes/), as are the icons in Eastern Orthodox churches, and the Leshan Giant Buddha in China (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leshan_Giant_Buddha).</p>

	<p>4. <strong>Architecture.</strong> We can also look at architecture as a text that can be &lsquo;read&rsquo; or interpreted. Choices made in the composition of a building, such as the adornment of walls with religious iconography, can have clear implications for how that building is understood and what it means for those who use it. An example of this is the Hindu <a href="http://londonmandir.baps.org/" target="_blank">BAPS Swaminarayan temple in Neasden, UK</a>, which was built according to an ancient religious tradition &ndash; you can read more about how and why the temple was built here: <a href="http://londonmandir.baps.org/the-mandir/how-it-was-made-in-detail/" target="_top">http://londonmandir.baps.org/the-mandir/how-it-was-made-in-detail/</a></p>

	<p>Now that we have a better idea of what a religious text is, we can consider the various functions that they perform; the most obvious of which is to hold information, providing a way for details, instructions, and narratives to be recorded and then accessed later. For instance, the Bible contains many books that are treated, or can be read, as history &ndash; the life of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels is a repository of the sayings and activities of the Christian messiah. In the same vein, the Qur&rsquo;an is believed to contain messages that God communicated to Muhammad and his people during the seventh century, including instructions on how to live in accordance with God&rsquo;s will.</p>

	<p>Generally speaking, information storage is a function that all religious texts perform there are no &lsquo;nonsense&rsquo; religious texts (even the <a href="https://principiadiscordia.com/book/1.php" target="_blank">Principia Discordia</a> was trying to communicate something &ndash; read at your peril fnord), however, there is certainly a difference between the meaning &lsquo;put into&rsquo; a text by its creator(s) and the meaning retrieved by the text&rsquo;s users.</p>

	<p>For example, it&rsquo;s unclear what meaning was intended by the builders of megalithic sites like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex" target="_blank">Giza pyramids</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge" target="_blank">Stonehenge</a>, yet these religious &lsquo;texts&rsquo; are nonetheless experienced as meaningful for many <a href="http://www.stonehenge-druids.org/stonehenge.html" target="_blank">modern people</a>.</p>

	<p><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><span class="fr-img-wrap" style="width: 640px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/126155/images/167/a4a/006/ancient-1853396_640.jpg"><span class="fr-inner">Stonehenge, England<br></span></span>&nbsp;</span>
	</p>

	<p>Sometimes, however, the thing to be communicated by a text cannot be recorded in words, paint, or stone; instead the text aims to point beyond itself to a feeling, an aesthetic response, or a spiritual experience. The romantic style of painting commonly used by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was chosen specifically by the organisation&rsquo;s founder, Bhaktivedanta Swami, to appeal to a Western audience, and to make the stories depicted in his translations of Vaishnava texts seem more realistic. The ISKCON artist Dhriti Dasi <a href="https://iskconnews.org/iskcon-painters-feature-krishna-in-california-art-exhibit,2442/" target="_blank">explained</a> that for some people &lsquo;...a book or harinam might not have elicited a favorable response to Krishna consciousness, but through these paintings they were attracted to Krishna...&rsquo;.</p>

	<p>Another example is the Zen Buddhist koan, a short narrative style that often employs non-sequiturs and impossible questions (<em>what is the sound of one hand clapping?</em>); although koans often feature historical characters, they aren&rsquo;t necessarily intended to preserve historical events exactly as they happened, but instead are intended to elicit a change in the perception and understanding of the reader.</p>

	<blockquote>Nansen saw the monks of the eastern and western halls fighting over a cat. He seized the cat and told the monks: `If any of you say a good word, you can save the cat.&#39;
		<br>No one answered. So Nansen boldly cut the cat in two pieces.
		<br>That evening Joshu returned and Nansen told him about this. Joshu removed his sandals and, placing them on his head, walked out.
		<br>Nansen said: `If you had been there, you could have saved the cat.&#39;
		<br>
		<br><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/gateless-gate/14.html" target="_blank">Nansen Cuts the Cat in Two</a></blockquote>

	<p>Koans suggest that the literal information stored in texts can be incidental to the <em>actual</em> purpose of the record and the text then becomes a vector for communicating emotional responses, spiritual experiences, and novel states of mind. These new religious experiences emerge from interactions between the text, the individual, and the cultural context within which they meet &ndash; your experience today reading a koan might be very different from that of a novice Zen monk in 12<sup>th</sup> century Japan.</p>

	<p>Part of the cultural context surrounding any encounter with a text is the established tradition of interpretation and &lsquo;authentic&rsquo; understanding; many religious texts are guarded by individuals and organisations that claim to know its &lsquo;real&rsquo; meaning. This additional information, preserved outside of the text itself, is often found by interpreting material allegorically, or using a special frame of reference to contextualise the events and individuals recorded.</p>

	<p>In the text of the Council of Trent, the Catholic church presented itself as the custodian of the authentic message of the Bible, and therefore only its translations and commentaries should be considered valid &ndash; no one should &lsquo;...presume to interpret the said sacred Scripture contrary to that sense which holy mother Church &hellip; hath held and doth hold&hellip;&rsquo; (<a href="http://bible-researcher.com/trent1.html" target="_blank">http://bible-researcher.com/trent1.html</a>).</p>

	<p>All of which assumes that the encoding of additional meaning is intentional in some sense, a hidden message left there by the original creator of the text, but in some cases the interpretation may be required simply due to ambiguities in the text. For instance, the Qur&rsquo;an itself points out that some of its passages are more vague and open to misinterpretation, stating:</p>

	<blockquote>It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - <strong>and others unspecific</strong>. As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except Allah.
		<br>
		<br><a href="https://quran.com/3/7" target="_blank">Qur&rsquo;an 3:7</a> &ndash; <strong>emphasis added</strong></blockquote>

	<p>Even though it has been codified in classical Arabic for centuries, there are still ambiguities when it comes to translating Qur&rsquo;anic passages that have dense, complex, or even contradictory meanings, and therefore Muslims generally consider any translation to be, by necessity, an interpretation, and instead are encouraged to read, listen to, and memorise the text in its original Arabic.</p>

	<p><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib" style="width: auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"><span class="fr-img-wrap" style="width: 640px;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/126155/images/ae0/564/c29/holy-quran-1528446_640.jpg"><span class="fr-inner">The Qur&#39;an<br></span></span>&nbsp;</span>
	</p>

	<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve discussed the storage of information within a text, the feelings that religious texts can elicit, and the meanings that can be extracted via interpretation; however, for texts that have a three-dimensional reality, people can interact in ways that don&rsquo;t require &lsquo;reading&rsquo; in a literal sense. The <em>material</em> aspect of a text can be just as important as its informational content, and can be read in a similar way.</p>

	<p>As a way to bridge written and artistic texts, we can look at the way that passages from the Qur&rsquo;an are used to both sanctify and protect buildings, clothing, and other artefacts. This has led to the production of talismans and amulets (<em>tilasm</em> and <em>ta&rsquo;wiz</em>), which contain sacred verses, names, or letters, and are used to protect the people who wear or use them. An excellent resource for viewing these is provided by the <a href="https://metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tali/hd_tali.htm" target="_blank">Metropolitan Museum of Arts</a>.</p>

	<p>A similar practice can be observed in many Jewish households, who store a portion of the Torah in a small container called a <em><a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/256915/jewish/What-Is-a-Mezuzah.htm" target="_blank">mezuzah</a></em>, which is affixed to their doorframes and often touched in remembrance as people pass through.</p>

	<p>It&rsquo;s not only written documents that can find expression and use via material culture: religious buildings, such as the cathedral of <a href="http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/en/" target="_blank">Notre Dame</a> in Paris, or the <a href="https://www.sgsss.org/" target="_blank">Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha</a> in Southall, are texts that can be entered into and interacted with. Religious architectural texts communicate their values and history through physical forms such as stained glass windows, iconography, reproductions of images and words, and statues of significant figures, while also providing a space for worship and contemplation.</p>

	<p>In contrast to the fixed form of the examples above, some religious texts may have a performative aspect, and can only be engaged with meaningfully through actions, or observation of the actions of others. Many oral texts behave in this way, and this allows for collaborative development over time. For instance the Oxlajuj B&rsquo;aqtun performance (which you can watch below) by the Guatemalan group <a href="http://www.gruposotzil.org.gt/" target="_blank">Grupo Sotz&#39;il</a> demonstrates how older religious texts (in this case the Popul Vuh) can inspire the creation of new oral traditions that engage with modern issues.</p><span class="fr-video fr-fvc fr-dvi fr-draggable" contenteditable="false"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmqhFrCP884" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315"></iframe></span>

	<p>In summary, we can see that religious texts record information in a basic sense &ndash; images depict objects, writings depict characters, buildings express styles &ndash; however, <em>literal</em> meaning is not the sole function of religious texts; they can also:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>encode (or be perceived to encode) additional information, which requires knowledge or insight to interpret;</li>
		<li>act as vectors for non-represented meaning, meaning that cannot be found in the text itself, but emerges as a result of interactions between the text, the observer, and the cultural context;</li>
		<li>provide an expression for material culture, taking a variety of forms;</li>
