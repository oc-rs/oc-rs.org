<img class="img-fluid mb-3" style="max-height: 300px" src="/img/understanding-religion-homepage.png">

Understanding Religion is a website that aims to provide easy access to information about the study of religion, published by the Online Centre for Religious Studies.

**Always free, written clearly for a wide audience, grounded in academic study and supported by references for those who want to dive deeper.**

It draws inspiration from a wide variety of online resources - notably Wikipedia, but also Harvard Universityâ€™s Pluralism Project and the essays and resources published by REOnline.

The goal of the site is to provide contemporary scholarship in an accessible format for readers who might not be specialists in the subject, but who want to learn and discover.
