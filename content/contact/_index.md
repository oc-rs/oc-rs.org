# Contact Us
We love discussing religious studies, so why not get in touch to let us know what you think about the yogacara school of philosophy, stone circles and druidry, or anything else that takes your fancy.

## Organisations
We are open to collaboration with other organisations, so if you think we might work together - we probably can!

## Writing for us
If you have an idea for a blog post, we will be happy to publish if we think it's suitable. We aim to keep our blog posts informative but readable, and welcome perspectives from academics and the public who may have experience or interest in the field. Unfortunately we can't pay for publication, but we won't ask you to surrender copyright - if you write something, it's yours.

### Subject
We welcome blog posts on the subject of religion, both as a category and a phenomenon - we are primarily interested in the academic study of religion, but may consider reflective / theological submissions.

### Word count
Posts should be between 800 and 2000 words, but if you have a longer post you'd like to share, we would be happy to consider it.

### Language
Submissions should be in English, however dual-language submissions can be made - we cannot assist with any translation work.

### Publishing elsewhere
You retain the copyright to any work that you submit; if you also want to post your work elsewhere that's fine with us!
