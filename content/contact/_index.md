# Contact Us
We love discussing religious studies, so why not get in touch to let us know what you think about the yogacara school of philosophy, stone circles and druidry, or anything else that takes your fancy.

## Organisations
We are open to collaboration with other organisations, so if you think we might work together - we probably can!

## Writing for us
If you have an idea for a blog post, we will be happy to publish if we think it's suitable. We aim to keep our blog posts informative but readable, and welcome perspectives from academics and the public who may have experience or interest in the field. Unfortunately we can't pay for publication, but we won't ask you to surrender copyright - if you write something, it's yours.

## How to reach us
You can reach us at <a href="mailto:info@oc-rs.org">info@oc-rs.org</a>, or find us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/the.online.centre.for.religious.studies/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_ocrs_/">Twitter</a>.</p>
