# Contact Us
We love discussing religious studies, so why not get in touch to let us know what you think about the yogacara school of philosophy, stone circles and druidry, or anything else that takes your fancy?

We are open to collaboration with other organisations, so if you think we might work together - we probably can!

You can reach us at <a href="mailto:info@oc-rs.org">info@oc-rs.org</a>, or find us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/the.online.centre.for.religious.studies/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_ocrs_/">Twitter</a>.</p>
