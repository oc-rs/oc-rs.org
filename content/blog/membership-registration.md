We will soon be introducing a new membership service called the **OCRS Portal**!

The Portal is designed to guide you into a world of scholarship and learning, with courses that will take you from the very basics right up to university-level knowledge and skills. Along the way you can dive into specialist subjects that interest you, communicate with other students, and engage with tutors and scholars.

#### What does it include?
* **All** OCRS online courses.
* A range of **library articles**, covering religious traditions from around the world.
* Access to student forums.
* Email support with your studies.

#### How do I join?
Keep an eye open for new developments posted here or on social media.

#### How much does it cost?
Membership is free, you can access the forums and library articles at no charge. The courses will be priced individually.

We're really excited to start this next adventure, and look forward to seeing you on the new site! Don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions - hello@ocrs.online.
