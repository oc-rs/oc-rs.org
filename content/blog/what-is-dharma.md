If you've studied Indian religious systems, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, you may have encountered the Sanskrit word 'Dharma' (or its Pali equivalent, Dhamma). In fact, even if you haven't studied Indian religions, there's a possibility you'll have bumped into the term elsewhere. Dharma is not as widely known as *Karma*, but it has nonetheless become part of the Western vocabulary (it even shows up in [Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_Initiative)).

The word Dharma comes from the Sanskrit root *dhṛ*, meaning “to hold fast, to make secure” (Doniger, 2010, p.201) - in other words, Dharma is what provides *the* central point of reference for life. Dharma replaced a similar principle described in the Vedas (holy texts for many Hindus) of *ṛta*, which was conceived as the underlying order of the universe, the correct law of movement and expression, towards which one paid proper attention and respect (Radhakrishnan, 1999, pp.78-9).

In Shyam Ranganathan’s introduction to Patañjali’s *Yoga Sutra*, he makes a strong case for considering Dharma as an ethical principle, which characterises the elements of life according to their moral value. Although the word can be translated as duty, righteous-living, law, truth, or the principle upon which the act of creation rests, Ranganathan argues that Dharma isn't merely these ideas in isolation. Duty by rite or force is an imposition rendered static by habit or convention, but *ethical* obligation is self-generating and dynamic - it's something that comes from within and provides an innate sense of order. In this sense, Dharma isn't 'order' in the sense of logical correctness or analytical conclusions, but that truth which relates to and substantiates all human interaction, the very basis of all activity.

Dharma can be considered in two mutually dependent aspects: first, the universal dharma (or *sanatana dharma*) was prescribed for all peoples, races, classes and castes. This is a foundational religious orientation towards the world, which attempts to reflect material order with spiritual order. As the cosmic principle finds expression in the regularity of the stars and the passing of the seasons, so too should it find expression in the rightly-guided actions of humanity, whose goal should be harmony and peace. (Doniger, 2010, pp.209-10) Whilst this goal may be commendable, it is also vague, and the plurality of minds, attitudes, aptitudes, and tastes, meant that it required significant qualification if it was to be of any practical use. This is where social specialisation (though not necessarily hierarchical stratification) becomes useful, and the second aspect of dharma appears.

&nbsp;

*Sva-dharma*, or individual dharma, refers to the universal principle as uniquely expressed by the individual and practiced as a moral duty or obligation. Such duty is tailored according to one’s age, position within society, and ability, and is alternately called *varnashramadharma*. This is why dharma not only *does *vary from person to person, but *must*, in order for society to function effectively. It is no use to form a society of Brahmins, only to find that no-one has the time or skill to sow crops, defend against invasion, or reproduce. It is essential that each part performs its role and duties, even if it may stand in opposition to the general principles of *sanatana dharma* or the *sva-dharma* of another.

&nbsp;

In the Bhagavad Gita, this message is reinforced, when Krishna explains to Arjuna that, “It is far better to discharge one's prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another's duties perfectly.” (vedabase.net, 2014). This stems not only from the practical concerns of organising a coherent society, but also from the need for individual spiritual development. The Gita describes a popular Hindu viewpoint, that the soul is on a journey of many lifetimes towards God; this helps to explain the *varnas* and *ashramas*, which viewed from this perspective become expressions of an individual’s spiritual heritage, or accumulated *karma*. However, this viewpoint is dangerous for a number of reasons: firstly, it establishes a hierarchy that values the priest above the householder, rather than considering them as mutually dependent and mutually important. The second potential danger is a fatalistic viewpoint, which assumes one’s caste is determined by one’s *karma*, and therefore the downtrodden, destitute, and deranged only have themselves to blame. The theory of moral cause and effect came to be “...an excuse for inertia and timidity and was turned into a message of despair and not of hope.” (Radhakrishnan, 1971: 55)

&nbsp;

Ultimately, dharma represents a principle of moral action which guides not only the individual and society, but the entire cosmos. It is the Hindu view that our lives are successful when we live according to the duties of our station; it does not outright condemn violence, sexuality, or wealth, but only seeks to align the right behaviour with the right context.
