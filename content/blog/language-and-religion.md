If you want to learn about religious practices, philosophical concepts, or ways of living, you will almost certainly begin by looking for resources in your native language - this is the easiest way to engage with new ideas, and the quickest way to get an overview. Most religious principles and practices can be explained in any language with a reasonable degree of accuracy - but what if you want to learn more?

The sacred and traditional texts of most religious systems are hundreds - sometimes thousands - of years old. In order to understand them fully, you need to understand the language that was used to compose them, the cultural setting in which they were written, and the intended audience. Fortunately, there are lots of resources available online to help!

Here are a few (in alphabetical order), but let us know if you think of any others. 

# Arabic
The Arabic language was used to compile the Quran, and the general perspective is that since the original recitation was made in Arabic, in order to truly experience and understand the message, one should read and understand the language of the original. You may notice that some translations of the Quran into English will avoid the term translation, and instead call the work an interpretation for this reason. There is a difference between Classical Arabic (the language of the Quran) and Modern Arabic (spoken in the world today).

## Qasid Arabic Institute
The <a target="_BLANK" href="https://qasidonline.com">Qasid Arabic Institute</a> offers a number of online courses that will help you develop your understanding of the Arabic script, as well as the language itself.

# Biblical Languages
The languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek were all used to compose portions of the Bible.

# Sanskrit
Let's start with Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, used for composing sacred texts and preserved by the priestly class of Brahmins. Many Hindu and Buddhist texts have been recorded in Sanskrit, including the Bhagavad Gita (itself part of the epic <a target="_BLANK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>). Recently there have been a few different online courses published to help students learn this language.

## The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies
Leading the way is the <a target="_BLANK" href="https://ochs.org.uk">Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies</a>, who in April 2018 launched their initial online Sanskrit course; it's proved popular and they now offer levels 2 - 4 (level 1 is not currently available, but will be offered again in July).
