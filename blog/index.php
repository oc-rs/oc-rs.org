                <h2>Literary Bias in Celebrity Big Brother</h2>
                <p>25 August 2018</p>
                <p>One of the important parts of studying religion is to be open to observations all the time (even if you’re curled up watching TV).</p>
                <p>On a recent episode of Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, two contestants were having a conversation about religion that caught our interest.</p>

                <p>19 July 2018</p>
                <p>There are, broadly speaking, two ways to approach religion as an academic subject.</p>
                <p>The first is based on a sort of family tree model; it looks a bit like this.</p>

                <p>24 November 2017</p>
                <p>Religion is often used as a by-word for rigid dogma and traditional patterns of behaviour, while open source is a technological term for freedom to examine, customise, and create without structure or restriction – however these different worlds actually have more in common than you might think.</p>

                <p>10 November 2017</p>
                <p>As practitioners of religious studies, academics are advised against investigating the truth claims of different religious traditions – it is one of those awkward subjects that cannot be reliably studied (hence the ongoing difficulties integrating scientific empiricism with religious accounts of the world).</p>

                <h2>The importance of religious literacy</h2>
                <p>4 November 2017</p>
                <p>Religion impacts many aspects of our lives, and religious events are all around us, both positive and negative. Over the last few years, the idea of improving religious literacy has been gaining ground, with the launch of the Religious Literacy Project at the Harvard Divinity School in 2015, and the publication of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Religious Education’s report (Improving Religious Literacy) in 2016.</p>
