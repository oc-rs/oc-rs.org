                    <p>Alternative voices, due to their absence in mainstream texts and dismissal by historical scholars, are sometimes difficult to hear over the sound of traditional narratives – but this is increasingly changing for the better. Where we can open ourselves to these voices, we can improve our understanding of the history of religion, but also our understanding of contemporary religious practitioners as well.</p>

<p>Female academic perspectives on religious literature, contesting or challenging male interpretations, have been developing over a long period of time. Towards the end of the 19<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century, Elizabeth Cady Stanton published <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Woman’s Bible<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, an academic translation and commentary on passages from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that relate to women, both in order to challenge popular (male) interpretations of the texts, and to shed light on problematic, misogynistic elements of the original material.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More recently, excellent work on this subject has been done by the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shiloh Project<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which looks at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rape culture<!-- raw HTML omitted --> both in the Bible and the contemporary world, and aims to:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also find a similar challenge to misogynistic interpretations of religious texts in the first translation of the Qur’an to be completed by an American Muslim woman – <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sublime Quran<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by Laleh Bakhtiar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One of the notable changes here is to verse 4.34, which has historically been used to justify domestic abuse and violence against wives. The Sahih International translation offers:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Whereas Bakhtier, with some <!-- raw HTML omitted -->strong justification<!-- raw HTML omitted --> renders the key word <!-- raw HTML omitted -->wadriboohunna<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as ‘to go away’ rather than ‘to beat’. Her version in full reads:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Postcolonial and feminist thinkers have helped to dismantle some of the assumptions that helped to reinforce the erasure of alternative perspectives, but it’s still common to talk about religions without exploring or appreciating these voices. As we explore religion, we should be mindful of our own biases and the biases in the material or societies we’re learning about.</p>
<p>Not only has the western definition of religion often ignored or marginalised women and indigenous people, it has also focused on the types of behaviour expected by those raised in Christian Europe. This cultural background has placed greater emphasis on religious texts and orthodoxy (‘right belief’), than on practice, community, or alternative perspectives from marginal groups in a society. In particular, racism, sexism, and religious chauvinism have sometimes been woven into the fabric of the academic field, and this is not always clear from looking at the surface, but nonetheless shapes how people think about and engage with religion in the world.</p>
<p>When it comes to examining and challenging the racism that has been implicit in the formative period of religious studies (an era of colonialism and empire), Malory Nye points out that it’s not enough to simply listen for alternative voices – our entire approach to the field needs to be grounded in a recognition of where its key concepts and ideas came from, and why certain voices are alternative in the first place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Stacey Swain notes that, when it comes to the existence of ‘religion’ outside of the European context in which it developed, the category is essentially forced over existing cultures, and only where these cultures fit the mould of Christianity were they recognised as religion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can see a real-world example of this in the December 2018 issue of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Journal of the American Academy of Religion (JAAR)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where the cover photo was a naked sadhu (Hindu holy person), who was having his feet touched by a woman. J. E. Llewellyn made the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->observation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that this photo may have been selected more for its shock value than for its alignment with the article it ostensibly supports, noting that it is '&hellip;a bit of an orientalist image' because the vast majority of sadhus are not habitually naked.</p>
<p>Russell McCutcheon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->takes this argument further<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, pointing out that the description applied to the image in the caption goes beyond mere description, and applies interpretation to the woman's intentions and experiences that it's extremely unlikely the editor was aware of (the photo was taken from Wikimedia Commons - hey look, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here's the original!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). The editor's comments, according to McCutcheon, reinforce the idea that it's appropriate for observers to interpret the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->real<!-- raw HTML omitted --> motivations behind religious activity, but this is inappropriate and speaks over - without ever admitting it - the legitimate voice of the people under study.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Do you think the journal cover would have had the same impact if they had used <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this image of the same scene from a different angle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and with different poses? Why not? What is being communicated in each image?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An example of how ownership of religious traditions, and knowledge about those traditions, can be reclaimed by indigenous people can be found in the Strehlow Research Centre, Australia. This organisation holds a vast library of digital resources relating to the native Aranda culture in Central Australia – access to which is restricted to those who have a background in that culture, and who understand the importance and significance of that knowledge.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can watch a presentation from Shaun Angeles Penangke, the Artwe-kenhe (Men’s) Collection Researcher at the Strehlow Research Centre, where he talks about the way that the centre operates, how it helps to support indigenous people, and the significance of the knowledge itself</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another example of the relationship between race, religion, and colonial history can be found in the case of the Easter Island ‘heads’ (actually full statues that were buried). The British Museum has held one of these moai statues for 150 years, and has not yet agreed to its return to the native Rapa Nui people, even though it was taken without permission in the late 1800’s as a gift for Queen Victoria, and represents one of the Rapa Nui ancestors.</p>
