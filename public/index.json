[{"categories":null,"contents":" If you\u0026rsquo;ve studied Indian religious systems, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, you may have encountered the Sanskrit word \u0026lsquo;Dharma\u0026rsquo; (or its Pali equivalent, Dhamma). In fact, even if you haven\u0026rsquo;t studied Indian religions, there\u0026rsquo;s a possibility you\u0026rsquo;ll have bumped into the term elsewhere (anyone remember the Dharma Initiative from TV show Lost?).\nThe word dharma comes from the Sanskrit root dhṛ, meaning “to hold fast, to make secure” (Doniger, 2010, p.201) - in other words, dharma is what provides the central point of reference for life. Dharma replaced a similar principle described in the Vedas (holy texts for many Hindus) of ṛta, which was conceived as the underlying order of the universe, the correct law of movement and expression, towards which one paid proper attention and respect (Radhakrishnan, 1999, pp.78-9).\nIn Shyam Ranganathan’s introduction to Patañjali’s Yoga Sutra (one of the key text for the Yoga school of Hinduism), the translator makes a strong case for considering dharma as an ethical principle, which characterises the elements of life according to their moral value. Although the word can be translated as duty, righteous-living, law, truth, or the principle upon which the act of creation rests, Ranganathan argues that dharma isn\u0026rsquo;t merely these ideas in isolation: duty by rite or force is an imposition rendered static by habit or convention, but ethical obligation is self-generating and dynamic - it\u0026rsquo;s something that comes from within and provides an innate sense of order. In this sense, dharma isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;order\u0026rsquo; in the sense of logical correctness or analytical conclusions, but that truth which relates to and substantiates all human interaction, the very basis of all activity. Just as the landscape and gravity shape the movement of water into rivers and streams which flow down toward the ocean, dharma shapes the moral landscape and provides an inner sense of ethical direction and inspiration towards what is right.\nIn the context of Hindu traditions, dharma can be considered in two mutually dependent aspects: first, the universal dharma (or sanatana dharma) is a framework for living prescribed for all peoples, races, classes and castes; it attempts to reflect the regularity of the material world with a complementary spiritual order or structure. As the cosmic principle of regularity and order finds expression in the movement of the stars and the passing of the seasons, the idea is that it should equally find expression in the rightly-guided actions of humanity, whose goal should be harmony and peace (Doniger, 2010, pp.209-10). Whilst this goal may be commendable, it\u0026rsquo;s also vague, and the plurality of minds, attitudes, aptitudes, and tastes, means that it requires significant qualification if it\u0026rsquo;s to be of any practical use. This is where social specialisation (though not necessarily hierarchical stratification) becomes useful, and the second aspect of dharma appears.\nSva-dharma, or individual dharma, refers to the universal principle as uniquely expressed by the individual and practiced as a moral duty or obligation. Such duty is tailored according to one’s age, position within society, and ability, and is alternately called varnashramadharma - varna being one\u0026rsquo;s class, or role in society, and ashrama being one\u0026rsquo;s stage in life. This is why dharma not only does vary from person to person, but must, in order for society to function effectively. It is no use to form a society of Brahmins (priests), only to find that no-one has the time or skill to sow crops, defend against invasion, or reproduce. In order for a community to thrive, it\u0026rsquo;s essential that each part performs its role and duties, even if the actions required might stand in opposition to the general principles of sanatana dharma or the sva-dharma of another.\nClass vs Caste It's worth pointing out that there is a difference within Hindu traditions between class and caste: class describes one's role within society, but is not tied to birth or circumstances beyond one's control - it's entirely possible that an individual might progress through several classes in the course of their life. Caste, on the other hand, is treated in a similar fashion to ethnicity, in that the label is tied to one's birth and origin, and it cannot be changed. Caste discrimination is a separate issue that is often confused with the varna system.\n  In the Bhagavad Gita, this message of doing one\u0026rsquo;s sva-dharma is reinforced, when Krishna explains to Arjuna:\n śreyān sva-dharmo viguṇaḥ\npara-dharmāt sv-anuṣṭhitāt\n“It is far better to discharge one\u0026rsquo;s prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another\u0026rsquo;s duties perfectly.”\nBhagavad Gita 3.35\n This attitude stems not only from the practical concerns of organising a coherent society, but also from the need for individual spiritual development. The Gita describes a popular Hindu viewpoint, that the soul is on a journey of many lifetimes towards God; this helps to explain the varnas and ashramas, which, viewed from this perspective, become expressions of an individual’s spiritual heritage or accumulated karma.\nHowever, this stratification is potentially dangerous for a number of reasons: firstly, it establishes a hierarchy that values the priest above the householder, rather than considering them as mutually dependent and mutually important. The second potential danger is a fatalistic viewpoint, which assumes one’s caste is determined by one’s karma, and therefore the downtrodden, destitute, and deranged only have themselves to blame (see Class vs Caste above). The theory of moral cause and effect came to be “\u0026hellip;an excuse for inertia and timidity and was turned into a message of despair and not of hope.” (Radhakrishnan, 1971, p.55)\nUltimately, there is no single definition of dharma, especially when looking across the broader spectrum of Indian religious systems, but even within Hindu traditions the interpretation and meaning of dharma can vary. Generally, we can say that it represents a principle of how to live in the world, which guides not only the individual and society, but the entire cosmos. Accordingly, people\u0026rsquo;s lives are successful when lived accordance with the duties of one\u0026rsquo;s station; dharma doesn\u0026rsquo;t outright condemn violence, sexuality, or wealth, but only seeks to align the right behaviour with the right context.\nReferences  Doniger, W.

Because RE is not just academic / sociological religious studies, but also sometimes confessional religious instruction, and moral and spiritual development, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to argue that parents should not maintain this right. The subject is not clearly defined, and has multiple interpretations and approaches, making universal rules and guidance difficult.\nThis situation is far from ideal, and organisations have been looking to resolve the issues and ambiguities built into this approach. In October 2013, the Religious Education Council published their review of the subject, after it was left out of a government national curriculum review. Notably, then-Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, commented in the report\u0026rsquo;s foreword that:\n All children need to acquire core knowledge and understanding of the beliefs and practices of the religions and worldviews which not only shape their history and culture but which guide their own development.\n This theme of understanding religions and non-religious worldviews was expanded by the Commission on Religious Education, and forms a key part of their proposals: to rename (and to some extent rebrand) Religious Education as Religion and Worldviews.\nThe inclusion of non-religious worldviews is necessary and relevant - the United Kingdom is a religiously diverse society, with a large number of the population not identifying with any established religious tradition, but nonetheless having a personal perspective on the world that informs their ethical decisions, their lifestyle choices, their relationships, work, and even their death and how their bodies are treated after death. None of this can easily be covered by teaching the fundamentals of Christianity, with lip service to a few other traditions.\n Non-religious worldviews have also become increasingly salient in Britain and Western Europe. According to the most recent British Social Attitudes survey, over 50% of adults identify as not belonging to a religion, with 41% identifying as Christian. The proportion of adults identifying as not belonging to a religion has increased from 31% in 1983 and has remained fairly stable around 50% since 20092 . While some of these individuals may identify with non-religious worldviews such as Humanism, many have looser patterns of identification or do not identify with any institutional worldviews.\nReligion and Worldviews: the way forward, 2018, p. 6\n Some consider the effort to include \u0026lsquo;worldviews\u0026rsquo; in the subject name as an attempt to place religious traditions such as Roman Catholicism on the same level as non-religious worldviews like Humanism - a so-called \u0026lsquo;dictatorship of relativism\u0026rsquo; in which religious institutions are forced to teach their students in one breath that their religion is the only truth, and in the same breath that all religions are equal and balanced. This attitude betrays a lack of understanding about the nature of religious studies, the conclusions it draws, and how it arrives at those conclusions. Plenty of religious studies scholars are religious themselves - there is no contradiction, and no burden is placed on religiously-affiliated institutions to engage in double-speak (any more than is placed on them to teach the theory of evolution and the story of Genesis).\nHow insulting..the authentically religious are not interested in power just the universal human right to their religious freedoms. What we learn from your name change agenda is your \u0026quot;dictatorship of relativism\u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash; Edmund Adamus (@EdmundPAdamus) February 20, 2019 \nThe choice of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; as a category and \u0026lsquo;worldviews\u0026rsquo; as a plural group makes a genuine attempt to demonstrate the diverse range of expression of spiritual, ethical, emotional, and social life for people in contemporary society. The singular form \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; leaves room to expand into critical studies of religion as a category, while also respecting the common understanding of the term. This flexibility to dive deeper into the subject is touched upon by Richard Kueh in a blog post for RE:Online:\n If it is the job of the RE teacher to enable pupils to grasp over time (and this is key – i.e. over the course of a curriculum) the nature, complexity and significance of worldviews, it may well be that one might begin by using binary language of ‘religion’ and ‘non-religion’ and build up to the more complex scene of worldview over time.\nKueh, 2019\n Another aspect of the CoRE proposal is a middle-ground between the locally agreed syllabuses used today, and the national curriculum used for other subjects. Recognising that - to a certain extent - pupils in different social areas might have different educational requirements (for example, if the majority religion in the area is Hindu, then Hinduism ought to feature in the curriculum), CoRE recommended a so-called national entitlement, which aims to provide clarity about the aims and purpose of RE, but permits local networks to agree some aspects of the curriculum.\nFurthermore, the CoRE proposals still allowed parents the right to remove their children from Religion and Worldview lessons - however this appears to be a concession not in line with the push towards an academic version of the subject. As long as the remit of RE (or RWV) remains tied to the spiritual development of the student, there will still be grounds for removing students - and this seems utterly counter-productive. The same argument would not be made for sociology, psychology, or biology - all subjects which investigate critical and crucial human behaviours and phenomena - the issue comes from any suggestion that religious studies can be equated with religious instruction. In an ideal world, this distinction would be more clear, and the validity of the subject better established.\nDespite these concessions, and a Herculian attempt to please educators, parents, pupils, and religious groups, there has been resistance - from Government.\nAfter the comprehensive attempt to solicit evidence, ideas, and feedback - to draft modern and innovate approaches - to bring religious education into better alignment with the needs and realities of contemporary British society - the response from Secretary of State Damian Hinds was \u0026lsquo;thanks, but no thanks\u0026rsquo;.\nYou can read his letter here: page 1 page 2\nThis is disappointing, but not the end of the story. It\u0026rsquo;s clear that in the UK there is a strong and passionate effort to improve the delivery and standards of religious literacy, whether that is achieved through Religious Education, Religion and Worldviews, or Religious Studies. At the OCRS we applaud this effort, and support the direction that the CoRE and other organisations are attempting to steer RE towards.\nYou can read a range of new blog posts over at RE:Online about the CoRE\u0026rsquo;s proposals.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2019/02/24/religion-and-worldviews/","tags":null,"title":"Religion and Worldviews | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":" If you want to learn about religious practices, philosophical concepts, or ways of living, you will almost certainly begin by looking for resources in your native language - this is the easiest way to engage with new ideas, and the quickest way to get an overview. Most religious principles and practices can be explained in any language with a reasonable degree of accuracy - but what if you want to learn more?\nThe sacred and traditional texts of most religious systems are hundreds - sometimes thousands - of years old. In order to understand them fully, you need to understand the language that was used to compose them, the cultural setting in which they were written, and the intended audience. Fortunately, there are lots of resources available online to help!\nHere are a few (in alphabetical order), but let us know if you think of any others.\nArabic The Arabic language was used to compile the Quran, and the general perspective is that since the original recitation was made in Arabic, in order to truly experience and understand the message, one should read and understand the language of the original. You may notice that some translations of the Quran into English will avoid the term translation, and instead call the work an interpretation for this reason. There is a difference between Classical Arabic (the language of the Quran) and Modern Arabic (spoken in the world today).\nQasid Arabic Institute The Qasid Arabic Institute offers a number of online courses that will help you develop your understanding of the Arabic script, as well as the language itself.\n Classical Arabic  Biblical Languages The languages of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek were all used to compose portions of the Bible.\nIsrael Institute of Biblical Studies The Israel Institute of Biblical Studies offers online courses in all three of these languages (they also offer courses in modern Hebrew and Yiddish).\nBiblical Hebrew  Beginner Improved Intermediate Advanced Expert  Biblical Greek  Beginner Improved  Biblical Aramaic  Beginner  Gurbani Gurbani is not a language per se, but the written words of the Sikh Gurus, recorded in a number of different languages throughout the Guru Granth Sahib, all using the same alphabet - Gurmukhi.\nThe Sikh Research Institute The SikhRI runs a number of online courses, including an introduction to the grammar of Gurbani.\n Grammar of Gurbani  Latin Not only the language of the Roman empire, its people, and their mythology; Latin formed the liturgical language for much of European Christianity, and still has some use in the Roman Catholic Church today.\nThe Open University The Open University offers a free introductory online course in Latin as part of their OpenLearn programme.\n Getting started on classical Latin  Pāli Pāli is an ancient Indian language, often used for recording Buddhist texts - such as the so-called Pāli Canon.\nThe Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies Led by Richard Gombrich and Alexander Wynne, the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies has released three online courses in Pāli so far.\n Pāli Level 1 Pāli Level 2 Pāli Level 3  Sanskrit An ancient Indian language, Sanskrit was used for composing sacred texts and preserved by the priestly class of Brahmins. Many Hindu and Buddhist texts have been recorded in Sanskrit, including the Bhagavad Gita (itself part of the epic Mahabharata). Recently there have been a few different online courses published to help students learn this language.\nThe Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies Leading the way is the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, who in April 2018 launched their initial online Sanskrit course; it\u0026rsquo;s proved popular and they now offer levels 2 - 4 (level 1 is not currently available, but will be offered again in July).\n Sanskrit: Level 1 Sanskrit: Level 2 Sanskrit: Level 3 Sanskrit: Level 4  Yogic Studies In January 2019, Yogic Studies launched their first online Sanskrit course.\n SKT 101: Sanskrit for Yogis  Other languages There are plenty of other languages in the world that have a deep relationship with religious traditions - including those from Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

If you find the content interesting, why not consider signing up?\nFemale academic perspectives on religious literature, contesting or challenging male interpretations, have been developing over a long period of time. Towards the end of the 19th century, Elizabeth Cady Stanton published The Woman\u0026rsquo;s Bible, an academic translation and commentary on passages from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that relate to women, both in order to challenge popular (male) interpretations of the texts, and to shed light on problematic, misogynistic elements of the original material.\nThey [Stanton\u0026rsquo;s translation committee] flag such passages to raise awareness about the pernicious influence of biblical misogyny on the culture of their own day. Urubshurow, 2008, p. 120 More recently, excellent work on this subject has been done by the Shiloh Project, which looks at rape culture both in the Bible and the contemporary world, and aims to:\n...investigate the complex and at times contentious relationships that exist between rape culture and religion, considering the various ways religion can both participate in and contest rape culture discourses and practices. Shiloh Project We also find a similar challenge to misogynistic interpretations of religious texts in the first translation of the Qur\u0026rsquo;an to be completed by an American Muslim woman \u0026ndash; The Sublime Quran by Laleh Bakhtiar. One of the notable changes here is to verse 4.34, which has historically been used to justify domestic abuse and violence against wives. The Sahih International translation offers:\nMen are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband\u0026#39;s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. https://quran.com/4/34 Whereas Bakhtier, with some strong justification renders the key word wadriboohunna as \u0026lsquo;to go away\u0026rsquo; rather than \u0026lsquo;to beat\u0026rsquo;. Her version in full reads:\nMen are supporters of wives because God has given some of them an advantage over others and because they spend of their wealth. So the ones (f) who are in accord with morality are the ones (f) who are morally obligated, the ones (f) who guard the unseen of what God has kept safe. But those (f) whose resistance you fear, then admonish them (f) and abandon them (f) in their sleeping place, then go away from them (f); and if they (f) obey you, surely look not for any way against them (f); truly God is Lofty, Great. http://www.sublimequran.org/translations.html Postcolonial and feminist thinkers have helped to dismantle some of the assumptions that helped to reinforce the erasure of alternative perspectives, but it\u0026rsquo;s still common to talk about religions without exploring or appreciating these voices. As we explore religion, we should be mindful of our own biases and the biases in the material or societies we\u0026rsquo;re learning about.\nNot only has the western definition of religion often ignored or marginalised women and indigenous people, it has also focused on the types of behaviour expected by those raised in Christian Europe. This cultural background has placed greater emphasis on religious texts and orthodoxy (\u0026lsquo;right belief\u0026rsquo;), than on practice, community, or alternative perspectives from marginal groups in a society. In particular, racism, sexism, and religious chauvinism have sometimes been woven into the fabric of the academic field, and this is not always clear from looking at the surface, but nonetheless shapes how people think about and engage with religion in the world.\nWhen it comes to examining and challenging the racism that has been implicit in the formative period of religious studies (an era of colonialism and empire), Malory Nye points out that it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to simply listen for alternative voices \u0026ndash; our entire approach to the field needs to be grounded in a recognition of where its key concepts and ideas came from, and why certain voices are alternative in the first place.\nThere should be no doubt that religious studies needs to go through a process of decolonization. But what does this involve, and how can this process get started? To get started, though, we need to realise that decolonisation is not the same as diversifying. The aim for diversity is to accommodate (\u0026lsquo;find room\u0026rsquo;) for \u0026lsquo;alternatives\u0026rsquo; and differences within an existing scheme which largely remains unchanged. Decolonization is about change. It is about responding to changes that are taking place well beyond the classroom \u0026mdash; and also changes that should be taking place. And it is about changing how people think, talk, and act through a radical engagement with a plurality of voices and perspectives that have been historically marginalised and silenced. Decolonization is not about \u0026lsquo;finding room\u0026rsquo; at the table, it is about changing the room. Nye, 2018 Stacey Swain notes that, when it comes to the existence of \u0026lsquo;religion\u0026rsquo; outside of the European context in which it developed, the category is essentially forced over existing cultures, and only where these cultures fit the mould of Christianity were they recognised as religion.\n...colonial era Europeans often characterized non-European societies as \u0026ldquo;primitive,\u0026rdquo; or lacking \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; qua Christianity and thus civilization; the territories that they inhabited was therefore terra nullius, empty land available for \u0026ldquo;discovery.\u0026rdquo; After occupying various territories for many years and despite the lack of a correlating native concept, Europeans and Euro-Americans also eventually \u0026ldquo;discovered\u0026rdquo; what became known as \u0026ldquo;Indigenous Religion(s)\u0026rdquo; in the areas in question. Such \u0026ldquo;discoveries\u0026rdquo; most often operate(d) through a logic of comparison to Christianity, and relative to the amount of control that colonial governments exert(ed) over Indigenous populations. Swain, 2017 We can see a real-world example of this in the December 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion (JAAR), where the cover photo was a naked sadhu (Hindu holy person), who was having his feet touched by a woman. J. E. Llewellyn made the observation that this photo may have been selected more for its shock value than for its alignment with the article it ostensibly supports, noting that it is \u0026#39;\u0026hellip;a bit of an orientalist image\u0026#39; because the vast majority of sadhus are not habitually naked.\nRussell McCutcheon takes this argument further, pointing out that the description applied to the image in the caption goes beyond mere description, and applies interpretation to the woman\u0026#39;s intentions and experiences that it\u0026#39;s extremely unlikely the editor was aware of (the photo was taken from Wikimedia Commons - hey look, here\u0026#39;s the original!). The editor\u0026#39;s comments, according to McCutcheon, reinforce the idea that it\u0026#39;s appropriate for observers to interpret the real motivations behind religious activity, but this is inappropriate and speaks over - without ever admitting it - the legitimate voice of the people under study.\n...I think it would be highly unlikely to hear this caption come from the mouth of the woman being depicted and whose actions are being decoded for the viewer via this misleadingly simple caption... Do you think the journal cover would have had the same impact if they had used this image of the same scene from a different angle and with different poses? Why not? What is being communicated in each image?\nOwnership and identity An example of how ownership of religious traditions, and knowledge about those traditions, can be reclaimed by indigenous people can be found in the Strehlow Research Centre, Australia. This organisation holds a vast library of digital resources relating to the native Aranda culture in Central Australia \u0026ndash; access to which is restricted to those who have a background in that culture, and who understand the importance and significance of that knowledge.\nIn 2005 a change to the Strehlow Research Centre Act allowed for the return of sacred objects from the collection to their custodians. This could occur where custodians could be identified and there was evidence to substantiate the claims of ownership. That evidence relies on a mix of archival research and extensive community consultation with the Central Australian Aboriginal community. Aranda customary law is governed by a complex system of rules based on kinship and country. The Aranda community are active participants in the repatriation process and several culturally qualified people are employed at the Strehlow Centre as Indigenous Research Assistants. Appropriate access to the collection is mediated through the Strehlow Research Centre Board and the senior custodians from the Aranda community. Strehlow Research Centre You can watch a presentation from Shaun Angeles Penangke, the Artwe-kenhe (Men\u0026rsquo;s) Collection Researcher at the Strehlow Research Centre, where he talks about the way that the centre operates, how it helps to support indigenous people, and the significance of the knowledge itself\n Another example of the relationship between race, religion, and colonial history can be found in the case of the Easter Island \u0026lsquo;heads\u0026rsquo; (actually full statues that were buried). The British Museum has held one of these moai statues for 150 years, and has not yet agreed to its return to the native Rapa Nui people, even though it was taken without permission in the late 1800\u0026rsquo;s as a gift for Queen Victoria, and represents one of the Rapa Nui ancestors.\nYou can read more about the case here, and you can learn more about the moai statues from the Easter Island Statue Project\nUltimately, the concept of religion comes with considerable historical baggage; we need to restructure our approach to religion and religious studies if we hope to be able to understand religious practitioners and traditions in a variety of contexts around the world. In the next section, we\u0026rsquo;ll look more closely at the roots of religion.\nAdditional reading You can watch a recording of the 2016 Frederick A.

However, there are plenty of misunderstandings about what religious studies means, or what it involves. Here are some of the \u0026lsquo;myths\u0026rsquo; that we\u0026rsquo;ve encountered\u0026hellip;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s for priests / religious people This one seems to most frequently relate to a perception that religion = Christianity and religious studies = being a better Christian. Very far from it! Religious studies looks at expressions and experiences from all religious traditions, including people with no particular religious affiliation. It\u0026rsquo;s not there to make you more (or less) religious, it\u0026rsquo;s there to help you understand religious systems, just like the study of politics or philosophy is there to help you understand the human patterns of thought and behaviour that impact our world.\nReligion is a sham, but spirituality is authentic Increasingly, people in Western nations are moving away from organised religion, but this does not mean that they are necessarily less religious. There is a growth of people who are religiously unaffiliated but who find meaning in spiritual activities or ideas - the so-called \u0026lsquo;spiritual but not religious\u0026rsquo; category. This is a more personal, customised version of religious activity, but it nonetheless comes under the umbrella of religious studies. In fact studying this type of spirituality is key to understanding religion in the modern world - it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not excluded from the conversation.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nReligion means Christianity This one, for obvious reasons, tends to crop up more in Western nations, but basically it\u0026rsquo;s a sort of religious provincialism that assumes there is one \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; form of religion, and if you\u0026rsquo;re talking about \u0026lsquo;religious studies\u0026rsquo; you must mean studying Christianity. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s good grounds for claiming that the idea of religion is heavily based on Christianity, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t easily map onto other religious systems, but even so, that\u0026rsquo;s all part of the investigation done by religious studies scholars.\nYou have to be an atheist This one comes at religious studies from another angle - claiming that since it\u0026rsquo;s an academic subject, you must be so distant and critical that the work can only be done by outsiders - and atheists are outsiders from every religious tradition. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t true - lots of crucial work is done by religious scholars, and they provide a useful insight into their own traditions, and a fresh perspective on other traditions. What\u0026rsquo;s most important is to be aware of, and transparent about, your own personal circumstances and how this may affect your work. Even atheists have bias!\nYou have to read holy books Well, sometimes - but honestly so much of religious studies is about the activity of people that you could easily spend all your time doing observations, talking to practitioners, experiencing festivals, visiting pilgrimage sites, and engaging with the material culture of religion that you might never sit down to read a book. Now of course, reading the books is a good idea, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the only aspect of religion, and it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that a religion is not just a book with some rules.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t criticise religion That depends - there is definitely room for dispassionate investigation and reporting on religious activities and beliefs, and sometimes what you find will clash with your own perspectives on what\u0026rsquo;s right and wrong. Highlighting these issues in a responsible and balanced way is key - you can certainly criticise religious practices, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to bear in mind that there is a fine line between criticising a practice you believe to be genuinely harmful, and claiming that an entire religious tradition is wrong or unjust.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s boring Really!? You might have an eternal, immutable soul that after death will journey to a realm of joyful bliss or unending torment. You might be a collection of psychological impulses surrounding a conscious fragment of the universe; after death you\u0026rsquo;ll reassemble a body and be reborn as an entirely new person, and you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for 14 billion years! There are people who are so emotionally stirred by the tragic death of their ancestor that they will beat and cut themselves every year, year after year, for over 1,300 years - don\u0026rsquo;t you want to find out more?\nAren\u0026rsquo;t you a little curious about magic, myth, or mushrooms? What about visions in the sky? Are UFOs part of the modern religious experience? Why is yoga so popular and where did it come from? Why does the Catholic Church have so much wealth? Are there different types of meditation? What\u0026rsquo;s the difference? Why do Sikhs give food to everyone? Why do Muslims give so much to charity? Why do Buddhists keep talking about having an empty mind? How come billions of people around the world and throughout history have touched some unspeakable mystery, wrapped it in words, and tried to pass the knowledge on? What is that? Is it some quirk of human biology or is it part of the fabric of the universe? Is there one mystery or many?

You have so little free time! Why spend it on learning about people\u0026rsquo;s beliefs, values, communities, and practices?\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;d argue, because religious systems are powerful, fascinating traditions. They come in all shapes and sizes, offer varied perspectives on who we are and why we exist, and offer glimpses of worlds we cannot see or touch, yet seem to inspire and motivate millions of people every day. They offer the very best, and worst, of human creativity, charity, and sometimes cruelty. They ask questions and provide answers about the foundations of the universe, not just in cosmological terms (as we find in the field of science), but in terms of human experience, value, morality, and meaning.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies?

Today, well known religious communities, from the Bah\u0026#225;\u0026lsquo;i Faith to the Quakers, draw on these traditions to build their own answers and establish their own frameworks for living.\nI could argue that due to the developments of communication technology, transportation, and migration over the last couple of hundred years, the world is a more multicultural place, with more opportunity for conflict and misunderstanding - but really that opportunity has always been there; there have always been alien cultures encountering each other and facing challenges of interpretation and understanding.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new is that we have the tools and the technology to encounter unfamiliar worlds from our own home, to share our lives and perspectives at the push of a button, to engage meaningfully with alternative ideas, beliefs, and ways of living.\nWe prosper and flourish when we face the world on its own terms, and a key part of that is understanding the religious traditions and cultures which form the foundation of life for billions of people worldwide.\nIt can sometimes feel like religion is a battleground, and there are challenges to religious literacy from reflexive political moods and violent ideological confrontations, but this only highlights how important it is to equip ourselves with balanced and insightful knowledge about the religious systems of the world. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to get an accurate picture of the world and all its unfamiliar traditions by following news stories and listening to the loudest voices - if we hope to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on, we need to understand the importance that religion plays in people\u0026rsquo;s lives, and take those experiences seriously.\nReligion is an area that is often presented as esoteric and mystical (therefore not suitable for study), a tool for social control by charismatic charlatans (therefore not suitable for following as a lifestyle), or dismissed as a psychological crutch used by the weak-willed and superstitious (therefore not something to take seriously). None of these assessments are grounded in a holistic understanding of the field, and don\u0026rsquo;t accurately reflect the impact and practice of religion on a worldwide scale.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth highlighting that religious studies isn\u0026rsquo;t about making you more religious or moral; it\u0026rsquo;s an academic subject that investigates the religious behaviours and beliefs of human beings - and carries all the benefits that come from a deeper understanding of who people are, and how they live.\nPersonally, I think there\u0026rsquo;s some really interesting stuff going on when people do religion, when they ask questions about meaning, truth, or beauty; when they talk to God, Allah, the Goddess, Kali, Krishna, or any other non-physical entity; when they change their clothes, their speech, or their habits to bring themselves into alignment with something that can\u0026rsquo;t be seen.\nPeople come up with some really amazing ideas and practices that make their lives different, that make them feel differently, to connect them to their past, present, and future. People find unique ways to uncover experiences of union, joy, bliss, insight, liberation, creativity, passion, pain, loss, mystery, and the unspeakable experience of awareness. People also go to tremendous lengths to preserve and shelter the practices, beliefs, and customs of those who came before them, because they feel intimately that these things are important, or even essential, and those chains of responsibility create communities which extend back through time for hundreds or sometimes thousands of years.\nSo when we investigate religious studies, we\u0026rsquo;re trying to see those creative and exciting ideas, those challenging techniques of mental and spiritual illumination, those weird and wonderful events that mystify and delight and terrify and hit us emotionally.\nAs scholars of religion, we\u0026rsquo;re not trying to gauge whether these ideas are true or false, nor are we trying to synthesise our own view on what the ultimate meaning of the universe is. But we can ask ourselves questions about how humans have responded to the big mystery and the little mysteries, the challenges and confusions of everyday life.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s increasingly important for people to be religiously literate; the reality of living in a multicultural society, where many worldviews interact, means that we need understanding and knowledge if we are to live together peacefully.\nUltimately, as we study religion, we also become enriched by the millennia of shared human experience encoded within faiths, traditions, and worldviews, and stand to benefit from our investigations.

Who is right? What makes them right?\nThe simple answer is to say that one religious system is true, the others are either misguided or outright fabrications. This is the same logic used by Richard Dawkins to undercut the truth claims of theists: he says that they share the disbelief of thousands of gods, he just goes one god further.\nReligion, the argument goes, therefore amounts to a collection of falsifiable claims and customs. At its extreme, the problem is solved by falsifying them all.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nThe more complex answer is a form of religious pluralism, which acknowledges that all religions hold some truth, and each offer a window onto the same light, although with different frames, perspectives, and interpretations.\nThis essentialist argument posits that religion is a unique category (sui generis) of human activity, and that it engages with a partially knowable sacred reality (see for instance the works of Rudolf Otto and Mircea Eliade). This sacred reality can sometimes break through into our normal, mundane world - visions of God, voices, possession, inspiration, and the like.\nFrom the pluralist standpoint, religion is much like a set of mathematical symbols; in the same way that mathematical truths exist independently of our equations and symbols, religious Truth (the sacred, divine reality) also exists outside of the ideas humans have about it.\nMany religions, or sub-traditions within religions, agree with this principle - and most mystical traditions outright state that god is formless and nameless, so any human labels are temporary and provisional, leaving some \u0026lsquo;wiggle room\u0026rsquo; when it comes to describing what the divine actually is.\nHowever, to be drawn into the question of which religion is right is to become engaged in a question of absolutes - and even to say that all religions contain some truth falls into the same trap by acknowledging the validity of the question.\n Has a dog Buddha-nature?\nThis is the most serious question of all.\nIf you say yes or no,\nYou lose your own Buddha-nature.\n(Mumon | The Gateless Gate)\n Mumon’s comment in the quote above is in reference to a Zen koan, a sort of philosophical problem designed to ‘break’ the enquirer’s reliance on logical analysis.\nThe koan itself reads: A monk asked Joshu, a Chinese Zen master: \u0026ldquo;Has a dog Buddha-nature or not?\u0026rdquo; Joshu answered: \u0026ldquo;Mu.\u0026rdquo;\nIt’s worth stating at the outset that koans are not intended for the sort of logical investigation we are about to apply, in fact we’re sort of missing the point by doing so, however it is nonetheless a useful analogy, and helps illustrate the principle.\nThe issue that Joshu was facing was that there is no way to slice the question that doesn’t result in a misunderstanding of buddha-nature, and a fall into absolutes. Why shouldn’t the enquirer fall into absolutes? Because they are human categories of understanding that rely on conventional knowledge - this works fine when we describe common events like dogs and air currents and volcanoes, but it fails utterly when it comes to the ground of all being, the ineffable, the transcendent. We find the same difficulties when we try to use conventional language to describe quantum mechanics. Therefore the only response possible that does not take this route is to negate the question altogether - mu.\nMumon cautions against interpreting mu as a simple negation (which is its etymology), since the negative implies a relationship with the positive, and the conventional boundaries of yes and no, good and evil, up and down. Instead, he points out, ‘\u0026hellip;you should feel like drinking a hot iron ball that you can neither swallow nor spit out.’ The point is that the dichotomy is flawed, inapplicable, mu.\nReturning to the question of truth in religion, we are faced with the same dilemma - we cannot reject the entirety of Christian theology; we cannot accept it either. We cannot reject outright the experiences of ayahuasca drinking shamans, nor can we embrace it as sovereign truth. We can\u0026rsquo;t hedge our bets and say, ‘this little bit of Islam is true, and this little bit of Sikhi is true, and this little bit of Shinto is true’, because we\u0026rsquo;re still trapped by the belief that a) the transcendent exists, and b) these categories apply to the transcendent with any degree of fidelity.\nInstead, perhaps the answer lies in acknowledging that true and false simply aren’t appropriate categories for the worldviews and traditions contained within religious systems. Whilst it\u0026rsquo;s easy to compare a traditional account of creation with a scientific theory and find conflicts, this misses the deeper meaning and significance of the traditional account; despite their similar appearance, these two stories about the world are not the same thing.\nFrom this perspective, religion is neither true, nor false, nor both, nor neither.\nJust as it isn\u0026rsquo;t appropriate to ask whether Mozart’s music is \u0026lsquo;more true\u0026rsquo; than the music of Madonna, it\u0026rsquo;s not appropriate to ask whether one religion is more true than any other. The categories of truth aren\u0026rsquo;t applicable to the subject, and aren\u0026rsquo;t accessible to us as investigators. Joshu\u0026rsquo;s advice places us on firm ground as academics, and frees us to look at religious systems with both insight and distance.\nThis article was originally published as The null set of religious pluralism on 10 Nov 2017.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2018/12/05/true-religion-and-religious-truths/","tags":null,"title":"True Religion and Religious Truths | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In the centuries following the death of Muhammad, the Arabian peninsula was altered dramatically. The nomadic tribes, whose previous relationships had been mercurial and often violent, had become unified in a great empire, intended (at least by the devout) to reflect the great unity of Allah. Yet there were numerous difficulties in governing such a vast and culturally diverse area, not least of which was managing political power in accordance with Islam.\nThis focus on the material realities, practical considerations, and legalistic conundrums, led some Muslims to move away from mainstream Islam and focus more on the internal aspects of tawhid (God\u0026rsquo;s unity); these were the Sufis.\nThe name \u0026lsquo;Sufi\u0026rsquo; itself is possibly derived from the Arabic word for wool (suf), in reference to the coarse wool clothing that early Muslim ascetics wore. Their approach aimed to unify the exterior shari’a (guidelines for living) with an internal experience of the divine truth (haqiqa) of Islam, by following a unique path (tariqa) of spiritual focus.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free email course: How to Study Religion \nThese spiritual techniques, in common with many other mystical traditions, included postures and breathing exercises, as well as recitation of the names of God. These were all intended to bring about a shift in consciousness that hinged on constant remembrance (dhikr) of Allah.\nBy taking God’s name into their heart through repetition of phrases such as La ilaha ilallah and Allahu Akbar, Sufis (and mainstream Muslims) aim to recognise their relationship to their creator; a relationship both of unity and also profound distinction. In some ways, this approach mirrors the wearing of tefillin by Jews, who follow the commandment to “\u0026hellip;put these words of mine on your heart and on your soul…” (Deuteronomy 11:18) as an act of remembrance. The repetition of a word or phrase is also found in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, where it is called a mantra.\nSome Sufis believe that to fail to recognise their fundamental relationship to God is to commit shirk, the sin of idolatry, as it presumes any causal agent sufficient in itself. Huston Smith, writing in The World\u0026rsquo;s Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions, uses the example of assuming that a lightbulb is illuminated by electricity: this assessment, without reference to the foundation of all existence, denies by omission the supremacy of Allah. Therefore dhikr helps to guide one through life, as a plant tilts its leaves toward the sun, so the individual re-aligns themself to Allah.\nHowever, dedicated ascetics, such as al-Hallaj in the early 10th century, took this practice further. Al-Hallaj claimed to discover a profound sense of unity with Allah, similar to the merging of Atman and Brahman in Vedanta Hinduism, and Meister Eckhart’s mystical claim of the unity of the soul with God. Much like Jesus, he claimed to be al-Haqq (the Truth), and much like Jesus, he was executed after his activity became politically inconvenient.\nThe mystic claims of Sufis, which emerge from their dhikr, are generally interpreted in a poetic or metaphorical sense, but Sufi activities are not without controversy in the Islamic world, and they have faced persecution and violence over the years. Since the supremacy of Allah is one of the central components of the Muslim faith (and the first of the Five Pillars), it can sometimes be difficult to reconcile tawhid (Allah\u0026rsquo;s unity, distinct from creation) with the borderline pantheistic viewpoints of some Sufi mystics. Nevertheless, their passionate return to consciousness of Allah serves as inspiration for many Muslims around the world.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2018/11/16/dhikr-in-the-sufi-tradition/","tags":null,"title":"Dhikr in the Sufi Tradition | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":" We are faced with a difficult task when it comes to defining contemporary yoga, since there are numerous variants, countless schools, and a broad spectrum of teaching.\nIn Western nations such as the United Kingdom, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely to be found in health clubs and gyms, where the focus is placed upon the development of physical fitness and emotional stability. An example can be found on the official website of Iyengar Yoga (a variant of Hatha Yoga), which describes the benefits of their technique as “good health, mental peace, emotional equanimity and intellectual clarity” with no reference to the liberation of the purusha from prakriti, despite citing Patanjali’s ashtanga yoga as the original source of the wisdom.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s clear that although yoga has not lost its place within the broader context of Indian spiritual thought, it has nonetheless become increasingly secular; viewed as an alternative therapy or fitness regimen, rather than a route to spiritual salvation.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nEven among those who pursue a spiritual goal through Yoga, the emphasis is less on converting to Hinduism, and more on the attainment of personal experience. This should not surprise us, as Linda Woodhead notes, within the United Kingdom, “\u0026hellip;a majority have become increasingly hostile or indifferent to institutional forms of religion, whilst remaining open to faith, a spiritual realm, or just ‘something more.’” (Woodhead, 2013)\nWe can see that this modern form of Yoga is a product of religious and cultural evolution over a period of more than two thousand years, and draws influence not only from the Indian subcontinent, but also the broader political and philosophical background of the Western hemisphere. Although yoga today shares its name with the introspective practices described in the Mahabharata, it\u0026rsquo;s no longer the same system of thought and no longer the same method of practice. Therefore it\u0026rsquo;s perhaps inaccurate to claim that modern yoga represents a combination of historical antecedents, if by this we understand a blind collision of Tantric ideas and Samkhya principles.\nThere is something more subtle involved, a more organic process of assimilation and adaptation, which suggests to us the idea of a species. Like any species, Y. contemporalis represents key traits of its progenitors, but it\u0026rsquo;s also demonstrably different from them; it\u0026rsquo;s neither better nor worse than its ancestors, instead it\u0026rsquo;s adapted to its environment, formed so as to become integral to the overall flow of the ecosystem of spiritual thought and feeling.\nThe species of yoga we are examining contains within its DNA (its Dharma Nirodha Abhyasa?) strands of thought from earlier species that were found to be successful, and were not degraded by the entropy of time. Other elements were lost or adapted as necessary, and the creature we see today bears only passing similarly to its Vedic heritage. Aside from this, we must also acknowledge that there is no permanence here, no final conclusion to the process, and new variants continually develop.\nAll of this being said, it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely true that significant historical events have made their mark upon the flow of religious thought in India, and we can find evidence for this within the principles and practices of contemporary yoga. In order to recognise this evidence, we should first familiarise ourselves with the two concepts of Tantra and Classical Yoga.\nWhat is Tantra? Tantra is a tradition of religious behaviour based upon a philosophy of immanent divinity, through which the mundane world can be imbued with divine attributes, and individuals can utilise physical manifestations as tools to help them attain liberation.\nSwami Nikhilananda wrote that, “the average man wishes to enjoy the material objects of the world, Tantra bids him enjoy these, but at the same time discover in them the presence of God. Mystical rites are prescribed by which, slowly, the sense-objects become spiritualized and sense attraction is transformed into a love of God.” (Swami Nikhilananda, 2007, p.20)\nThese sense-objects can be statues or idols, which in turn become objects of worship and reverence, but crucially, the human body itself can be recognised as a spiritual entity, a microcosm of the godhead. This runs counter to the advaitic notion of the world-as-illusion, and instead embraces the world as a real - although temporally limited - expression of God.\nThe practice of Tantra can be divided into two aspects: left and right handed. The right handed (dak?i?acara) is generally considered orthodox today, and deals with aspects such as puja and bhatki, adhering relatively closely to the traditional interpretation of Hinduism; however, the left hand aspect (vamacara) is concerned with unorthodox methods such as the divinisation of sexual union or consuming bodily fluids, and encourages practices which may shock or offend.\nThe influence of tantric thinking on yoga was largely cultural, with a broadening development of ideas such as the importance of bodily purity, asanas, and breathing (as a route to controlling prana). These practices - rooted as they are in the material structures of human anatomy - have heavily influenced contemporary western yoga, with its particular focus on physical health and wellbeing.\nThis shift of focus from attaining mental and spiritual power, to cultivating skeleto-muscular finesse is placed in an interesting context by Wendy Doniger, who makes note of Shiva’s role in delivering Tantra to people who are cursed to lose contact with the Veda:\n “The \u0026lsquo;left-hand\u0026rsquo; doctrines help them by giving them some religion, albeit a heresy, since they are denied the Vedas; the heresy serves as a staircase between non-Vedic and Vedic religion…”\n Doniger later suggests that the tantric attitude was that it was, “\u0026hellip;better to bow to Shiva with your sandals on than never to bow at all.”\nThe observation can certainly be made that this pragmatic attitude towards inculcating religion in proportion to the spiritual capacities of the seeker has led to a spiritual exercise in the secular West that has become stripped - in popular consideration - of all overt religion. The idea finds agreement with the first verse of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, when Svatmarama claims that Hatha Yoga “\u0026hellip;shines forth as the ladder to be used by one who seeks to scale the heights of raja-yoga.”\nTextual sources that expand the principles of tantric yoga include the Shiva Samhita, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and the Gheranda Samhita, all of which were most likely written in the last six hundred years, some distance from the earliest dates for Classical Yoga.\nThese texts pay particular attention to pranayama and asana, which are given little attention by Patanjali, and scarcely mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita or the Upanishads.\nFor instance, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika (Ch2.4) offers a pragmatic and logical explanation of pranayama’s importance in relation to the spiritual topography of the body:\n “Whilst the nadis are afflicted by impurity the breath will not pass along the middle course. As long as this is case how can one remove all thoughts from the mind and how can one achieve success?”\n While the emphasis is placed on bodily purity, its ultimate goal is still in line with Patanjali’s chitta-vrtti-nirodha, and Svatmarama takes care to establish a connection with the older tradition.\nTantra’s influence is clear in several yogic concepts relating to the subtle energy channels, or nadis, and their confluences along the center of the body, known as cakras. It\u0026rsquo;s also responsible for the concept of the kundalini, a tremendous storehouse of spiritual potency that is conceived as a coiled serpent at the base of the spine.\nAnother aspect of Tantra that is found in contemporary yoga is the reverence accorded to gurus, and their status as individuals who have successfully divinised their bodies, essentially becoming an avenue towards God for the aspirant.\nWhat is Classical Yoga? The earliest references to yoga are found in textual sources such as the Upanishads, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita, which could have been composed as early as 400BCE (Urubshurow, 2008, p.248). Later, the teachings were systematised by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras, writing around 150CE (Doniger, 2010, p.505).\nThe key element in classical yoga is mental control, as the goal is essentially psychological (liberating knowledge, or jñana); relatively little importance is placed upon the material circumstances of one’s embodiment. In contrast to the panoply of asanas that exist today, with their variegated physiological results, the injunction in classical yoga was much more simple: “sit down somewhere quiet.” For instance, in chapter six of the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna advises:\n “Let [the yogi] find a place that is pure and a seat that is restful, neither too high nor too low, with sacred grass and a skin and a cloth thereon. … With upright body, head, and neck, which rest still and move not; with inner gaze which is not restless, but rests still between the eyebrows; with soul in peace, and all fear gone, and strong in the vow of holiness, let him rest with mind in harmony, his soul on me, his God supreme.” (Mascaro, 1962: 70)\n And again, in the Svetasvataropani?ad:\n “With upright body, head, and neck lead the mind and its powers into thy heart… And when the body is in silent steadiness, breathe rhythmically through the nostrils with a peaceful ebbing and flowing of breath. … Find a quiet retreat for the practise of Yoga, sheltered from the wind, level and clean…” (Mascaro, 1965: 88)\n The general principle of yoga, the foundation upon which Patañjali elaborates, is mental control: “yogas-citta-v?tti-nirodha?” cultivated through continuous effort (abhyasa) and detachment from worldly concerns (vairagya); these important traits are also recommended in the Bhagavad Gita, when Krishna notes:\n “The mind is indeed restless, Arjuna: it\u0026rsquo;s indeed hard to train. But by constant practice and by freedom from passions the mind in truth can be trained.” (Mascaro, 1962, 72)\n The same precise terms are used here as in sutra 1.12 of the Yoga Sutras, suggesting that they are an integral part of the practice.\nThis focus is part of a broader spectrum of activity that Patañjali codified as a??anga yoga, or the eight limbed yoga. The different limbs are given in the Sadhana-pada as\n yama (moral restraints) niyama (observances) asana (posture) pranayama (control of the breath) pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses) dharana (concentration) dhyana (meditation) samadhi (spiritual absorption)  These limbs are presented in sequence, and are intended to form an ascending series of spiritual techniques that culminate in an experience of absorption in the divine, which not only neutralises earlier psychological impressions (or samskaras) that negatively condition thinking and behaviour, but also allows the practitioner to dissociate their spirit (puru?a) from the physical embodiment of their birth (prak?ti) and achieve freedom from bondage, or isolation (kaivalya).\nThis interpretation of liberation is based upon the absolute dualism of Samkhya philosophy, and the two strands of thought were closely linked during this early period; it was only later that Vedantic and Tantric attitudes rose to dominance and shaped the yogic cosmological picture.\nConflicts, Congruences, Conclusions\u0026hellip; In today’s yoga we find the echoes of Krishna’s words to Arjuna to seek balance, restrain thought, and devote oneself to the moment; we find the technical terminology of Patañjali, and frequent appeals to his authority.\nAs yoga has passed through the blossoming of Vedanta, it has been augmented with the cosmology of Sa?karacarya, and the concept of union between atman and brahman has become central, adapting the earlier divisions of puru?a and prak?ti into a new synthesis.\nThen, the entire process was reinterpreted in light of Tantra to provide a structured route to liberation that embraced and explored the physical world. This new yoga allowed aspirants to employ signs and symbols along the way that were not abstract constructs; the constructs were instead grafted onto gurus, onto statues and idols, onto the yogi’s own body. The focus had shifted from the cultivation of psycho-spiritual states that transcended the body, to the divinisation of the body itself.\nIf these systems were to be considered in isolation, there would be countless conflicts of ideology and methodology, yet instead syncretism and adaptation dominate.\nHence, yoga is not confused by these amalgamations of philosophies, but enriched by them. Religious thinkers and practitioners have drawn upon a variety of sources over a prolonged period to create the modern cultural phenomenon of \u0026lsquo;yoga\u0026rsquo; but it would be a mistake to regard this as one unbroken chain reaching far back into antiquity, with a perfectly preserved singular practice.\nBibliography  Woodhead, L (2013) Why no religion is the new religion, [online] Available at: http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/blogs/linda-woodhead/why-no-religion-is-the-new-religion/ [accessed 1 October 2018] Swami Nikhilananda (2007) The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, New York: Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center Doniger, W (2010) The Hindus: an Alternative History,Oxford: OUP Mascaro, J (1962) The Bhagavad Gita, London: Penguin Books Mascaro, J (1965) The Upanishads, London: Penguin Books  ","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2018/10/01/the-foundations-of-modern-yoga/","tags":null,"title":"The foundations of modern yoga | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":"One of the important parts of studying religion is to be open to observations all the time (even if you\u0026rsquo;re curled up watching TV).\nOn a recent episode of Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, two contestants were having a conversation about religion that caught our interest.\n Rodrigo: I heard that you are a Scientologist, is that right?\nKirstie: Yes\nR: Can you tell me, what is it exactly?

Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nThe idea that it is possible to understand a religion (and by extension, the beliefs and practices of a religious person) by reading its written texts, especially its scripture, is misleading at best.\nReligious people draw inspiration from religious texts, this is fairly uncontroversial, but no religious text exists in a perfect bubble of meaning. Every text must be read and interpreted in the light of its prevailing culture, which includes additional ideas, interpretations, and perspectives.\nFurthermore, the relationship between a religious text and the practices of those who claim it is not perfect; few Christians adhere to the Bible\u0026rsquo;s instructions exactly as written, and even the Quran - believed to be the literal word of God - is embedded within a long historical process of interpretation, application, and supplemented by the example of the prophet Muhammad\u0026rsquo;s life (the hadith) and individual personal conscience.\nWe also encounter this difficulty with the recent debate about veiling in Islam, particular the wearing of burqas and niqabs by women in Western countries. This practice has been criticised by a number of individuals (including the UK foreign secretary), and outright banned in public in a number of European nations. These attempts to restrict the practice of veiling women have been criticised as an attack on religion by some, yet the response is often that the practice is cultural not religious, because the Quran does not mandate it.\nIf the Quran were the single source of religious practice, the Islamic world would be a far less vibrant and complex place, because in truth no religion (as far as we can comfortably isolate such a thing) is contained within its holy scripture. Religion exists in people, and people come up with new ideas, they read old words in new ways, and they find innovative ways to apply old principles.\nNone of which is to claim one side or the other of the veiling debate is \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo;, but simply to say that a religion is more than its books, and to rule something out as non-religious on the basis of its absence from a text is problematic and counter-productive.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2018/08/25/literary-bias-in-celebrity-big-brother/","tags":null,"title":"Literary bias in Celebrity Big Brother | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":"There are, broadly speaking, two ways to approach religion as an academic subject.\nThe first is based on a sort of family tree model; it looks a bit like this.\n Religion ==Christianity ----Catholicism ----Eastern Orthodoxy ......Greek Orthodox Church ......Russian Orthodox Church ----Protestantism ......Methodism ......Evangelism  And so on.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s useful from a historical perspective, because we can easily trace back along a tradition\u0026rsquo;s lineage to see where it diverged from its closest neighbour.\nBut if we collapse the hierarchy, we lose all that distinction. Methodists and Evangelicals are just Protestants. Protestants and Catholics are just Christians. Christians and Muslims are just religious people.\nThis collapse of the hierarchies happens often in the teaching of religion because there are a lot of different sub-traditions. Hundreds, if not thousands. It\u0026rsquo;s just not feasible to learn all of them.\n Interested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nSo, people learn what Christians generally believe and usually practice. The same goes for Muslims, Hindus, and any other \u0026lsquo;top level\u0026rsquo; religious tradition (top level only in the sense of this family tree model).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a danger here - so frequently encountered that it\u0026rsquo;s got its own name: the world religions paradigm.\nThe world religions paradigm is a way of thinking about religion that tends to look at the largest religious groups (the \u0026lsquo;world\u0026rsquo; religions), and not only ignores smaller, or more localised traditions, but glosses over the internal diversity within these larger groups.\nThe family tree model is useful, but not entirely accurate.\nThere is an alternative approach.\nIf we look more closely, we can see that each religious group, sub-group, and individual, shares certain characteristics even if they\u0026rsquo;re not directly related. So, for instance, we might notice that worship of a deity is a common theme for many religious traditions (but not all). We could then start to rebuild the family tree based not on historical lineage, but on practical and conceptual convergences.\nIn other words, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it make sense to group the worship with the worship, the salvation with the salvation, and the transcendance with the transcendance?\nThen we can start to build an image of the sorts of beliefs and behaviours that are common to religion as a whole, illustrated by examples drawn from across the world.\nRather than giving a laundry list of what religion X believes, we want to bring together Christian prayers and Sikh prayers, Islamic offerings and Hindu offerings, Jain rituals and Zoroastrian rituals, and see how much similarity runs through them.\nThen we want to stand religious neighbours together and show how much diversity separates them. Why aren\u0026rsquo;t Protestants and Catholics the same? Where is the split between Sunni and Ahmadiyya Muslim communities? How can Vaishnavite Hindus worship Vishnu as the supreme deity while Shaivite Hindus praise Shiva as the ultimate?\nWhilst it\u0026rsquo;s important to preserve an accurate sense of religious traditions as they exist in the popular consciousness (i.e. the world religions paradigm), we would recommend this alternative, thematic approach for the academic study of religion - and this is the approach that the OCRS will endeavour to support in its own teaching.\nEach \u0026lsquo;instance of religiousness\u0026rsquo; (a term that avoids the dichotomy of internal experience and external expression) represents both a functional purpose (community cohesion, cosmology, etc.) and a substantive experience (personal salvation, communion with God, etc.), situated within a cultural context.\nThe aim of this approach is to present \u0026lsquo;instances of religiousness\u0026rsquo; as situated within a network of related instances, based on key attributes drawn from functional and substantive assessments, and including insider and outsider perspectives.\nWe must be careful, nevertheless, to ensure that we don\u0026rsquo;t try to make these instances equivalent - they are still very much unique, and will still have many interesting and substantial divergences between each other.\nTo present a linguistic analogy, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in the differing expressions of a feeling or object in languages across the world. Rather than providing a prescriptive description of \u0026lsquo;how French people speak\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;how Chinese people speak\u0026rsquo;, we would consider the human tendency to greet people, with case studies drawn from various cultures and contexts - for instance bonjour and ni hao could be examined as examples.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s still important to understand the context, since otherwise rich and complex traditions could be flattened and religious behaviour would be abstracted to serve the purposes of illustrating preconceived categories. The categories should emerge from an investigation of religious behaviour and experience, not the other way around.\nWe want to upend the idea that a person\u0026rsquo;s religion is simple, contained, and static. Instead we want to shed light on the dramatic dynamism that exists in people\u0026rsquo;s attempts to find meaning and purpose within the universe, and how the techniques, narratives, and ideas that they develop can bring people together and tear them apart.\nIn short, we want to show how really, REALLY interesting religion is.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2018/07/19/thematic-approaches-to-the-study-of-religion/","tags":null,"title":"Thematic approaches to the study of religion | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Religion is often used as a by-word for rigid dogma and traditional patterns of behaviour, while open source is a technological term for freedom to examine, customise, and create without structure or restriction - however these different worlds actually have more in common than you might think.\nThe term ‘open source’ originates in the world of computer programming. It was coined in 1998 as part of an effort to promote the principles of collaborative development, and encourage businesses to share the source code for their projects.\nThe benefits of this strategy go beyond the provision of free software for users (although this is a strong reason for its popularity); by allowing the entire world to examine and improve their work, organisations stand to benefit from improved products and better relations with consumers. It also makes the software more popular if users know that creators are not hiding anything from them, and ultimately they are free to make changes on their own system without incurring legal penalties.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nWhere users encounter open source software that doesn’t quite fit the bill, they will often diverge from the main release by creating their own version - a process known as forking (fork as in road, not fork as in dinner). This empowers people to take control of their own software, and even the operating system that runs the software (for instance Linux, an open source alternative to Windows and Mac). Just as in philosophy it’s important to explain the steps of an argument, and in mathematics it’s important to record your workings, in an open source project it’s essential that you provide the basic information for someone else to reproduce the end product.\nThis approach to software has also had repercussions in other areas of life: and has been applied to politics, culture, and knowledge - the most obvious example is Wikipedia, which opens its encyclopedia to everyone, not only to read, but also to contribute, create new pages, and moderate existing ones.\nThere are two underlying principles of the open source movement: accessibility (freedom to access the source code) and flexibility (freedom to change the source code).\nMany religions are well ahead of the game when it comes to making their foundations accessible, and will freely distribute copies of their sacred texts, and share their basic principles, key beliefs, and practical guidance online. However, there is undoubtedly resistance to freely changing these texts, and remixing principles and practices to suit the individual. It is difficult to reconcile the idea that the Qur’an is the perfect and absolute word of God with an approach that treats its truths as provisional, relative, and open to improvement.\nThis tendency towards conservatism in religion is not universal, nor is it insurmountable - as the countless births of new religious traditions can attest. A notable example is the The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, created by American president Thomas Jefferson, who literally cut and paste the sections of the New Testament he found most appropriate and aligned to his own belief, asserting that theologians and priests had taken to ‘\u0026hellip;sophisticating and perverting the simple doctrines [Jesus] taught…’ (sacred-texts.com). Jefferson had no interest in the miraculous and metaphysical elements of the Gospels, and instead believed that Jesus was a man who preached a simple message of devotion to God and humility of spirit.\nAnother example is the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of the Sikhs, which was composed over several generations, building a corpus of recognised works by authors from a variety of religions and social groups - not just the Sikh Gurus themselves. This approach incorporated texts that aligned with the spirit and message of Sikhi, and could be understood therefore as authentic and spiritually worthwhile even if they sprang from different traditions.\nThe SGGS was established as the final successor in the line of Gurus, and cannot be altered; it is treated no differently to a human Guru, and must be accorded the utmost reverence and respect (check out these videos from Sikh Dharma International and BBC Teach for a good introduction). To cut and paste a physical copy of this text, as Jefferson did to the Gospels, would not be acceptable.\nHowever, these material products of a religious culture are nonetheless available for all, and there are many viewpoints on whether this sacrality should limit how the texts are engaged with. Artists such as Meg Hitchcock, have elevated cutting and pasting to an art form:\n A Bible, in one example from the show, is cut up and the letters are turned into the Buddhist mantra, “om mani padme hum,” repeated 10,000 times. In this way, one text is transposed into another. (Brent Rodriguez-Plate, 2017)\n A more fluid interpretation of scripture can be found in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), who constantly refine and develop their own so-called Book of Discipline, and incorporate historical quotations they deem useful or meaningful, alongside passages that are decided within the organisation at yearly meetings. Different countries produce their own variants - for instance in Britain the book is called Quaker Faith \u0026amp; Practice and is currently in its fifth edition - you can read a digital version online for free. Quakers also take a more flexible approach to worship; there is no clergy, priest, or holy person who leads the congregation, instead all members gather in silence, and are free to contribute verbally if they feel inspired to do so. Again, we can see echoes of the open source ethos.\nLike the Quakers, many religions have attempted to make their texts available online, to improve accessibility and ensure that adherents can investigate the \u0026lsquo;source code’ for themselves. Some notable examples include:\n Access to Insight\u0026rsquo;s copy of the Pali Canon This digital copy of the Qur\u0026rsquo;an, including the original Arabic text and multiple English translations Biblegateway, providing multiple translations in world languages, and study support Witchology\u0026rsquo;s copy of Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition Early Buddhist texts in their original languages, plus English translations at SuttaCentral Original text, transliteration, and English translation of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib The Bhaktivedanta Vedabase provides English translations of many Hindu Vaishnava texts  In addition to this, the non-denominational sacred-texts.com makes many religious and spiritual writings available free of charge. This availability has increased the ease of access in a similar fashion to the first printing presses; it is now much easier to read the Bible, Qur’an, or Dhammapada. This is certainly of great benefit to both religious practice and study. It has facilitated easier searching for specific passages or topics, since every word can be searched near-instantaneously, it is no longer necessary to leaf through indexes or investigate irrelevant pages. A half-remembered quotation can be entered into Google, and return the result immediately.\nHowever, there may be a corresponding loss of sensitivity to the reality of the text without a physical representation that can be touched (or not touched). It is more difficult to reverentially approach a webpage, open and close it carefully, and give it pride of place at a shrine or place of worship. Books are also universally recognised, requiring no operating system or file configuration to read, and scrolls that are thousands of years old are still decipherable.\nOf course, religion is more than just texts; religion is architecture, posture, aroma, feelings, sounds, food, song, dance, meaning and purpose, danger and mystery, passion and love. It does not begin and end between the covers of a book. There are practices and ways of life that bring the sacred into the material world and provide meaning to adherents. Religions hinge on the idea that transformative experiences and encounters with the divine are possible by following prescribed steps. Whether the experience comes during life or after it, we are nonetheless promised that one practice or another will bring us into alignment with the absolute, and expose us to the supramundane.\nThe routes to these encounters are as varied as the individuals who follow them, and include contemplation, prayer, entheogens, meditation, austerities, yoga, and service to others (to name a few). One way to view these practices is as cultural artefacts, set like immovable gems within the traditions that discovered and developed them. From this perspective, to blend yoga with Wicca, or the eucharist with fire worship, is at best misinformed appropriation, at worst theft.\nHowever, a more cosmopolitan perspective may situate these traditions in a broader human context, and see them - much like medical theories and political systems - as open to collaborative efforts to experiment, incorporate, and take ownership of. In a society that has taken information sharing to colossal extremes via the internet, some might take the view that spiritual techniques should be free to individuals not just in the financial sense, but in the sense of liberty.\nAn example of a religion that attempts to follow this line of thought is Yoism, which finds meaning in the communal search for truth, and uses what they call the Open Source Truth Process to arrive at religious meaning, and incorporates practices and traditions that Yoans find to have personal significance.\n Yo is a Living Religion whose core writings will evolve over time as people from all over the world provide input and improvements. Not only do we believe the collaboration and combined insights of all the members allow for a more intelligent and deep religious vision, we also believe that the process itself is inherently beautiful and spiritual. (yoism.org)\n The vast knowledge available about spiritual traditions around the world is empowering, yet also daunting; while there is great potential for new religions to arise - like Yoism - that incorporate their own preferred doctrines and techniques, there are rarely local communities and established organisations to provide support and guidance to newcomers.\nThere are also legitimate concerns that this attitude towards culture and religion is an enduring form of imperialism; it may be inappropriate to cherry-pick religious practices as though they did not emerge out of a foreign history - particularly if that foreign culture was subjugated by one’s own. In addition, these traditions can easily be misunderstood and misused if taken out of the culture that engendered them.\nThere are two responses to this - the first (weaker of the two) is that the history of religion is the history of religious innovation, collaboration, and syncretism. Like all human endeavours, these colossal cultural constructions do not emerge from a vacuum - they are part of an ongoing narrative between (often competing) people. If there is a quintessential religious impulse, it is transcultural. In other words, there is no sense in trying to stop people from sharing ideas, even if they do so in a haphazard or disrespectful way.\nThe second response is a product of the same technological process that created open source - the creative commons licence.\nThough designed for navigating the difficult ground of copyright law, these licences can nonetheless inspire us to consider how to treat units of religious practice and theory (if such a thing can be abstracted). The Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International licence provides permission for users to share the licenced material and make changes, even to profit from doing so, but they must preserve the licence, and attribute the original author of the work.\nIf we apply this logic to the use of religious theory and practice, we can see that an open source approach would be able to incorporate such religious entities, whilst also maintaining clear roots back into the traditions from which they emerged. This tactic may find increasing favour with those in Western nations who find difficulty subscribing to a single religion, yet who are not atheistic or opposed to spirituality - so-called ‘religious nones’ and the related group of ‘spiritual but not religious’.\nThe well known scriptures of the world are sealed by their respective traditions and authorities - however it is not fair to say that people have never challenged this traditionalism, and there have been many religions that developed by customising their existing canon, welcoming new practices, and taking a more flexible approach to engaging with the divine. In many ways, the religious world has moved towards an open source approach, making itself available, accountable, and engaging directly with the individual - yet there is room for those religiously unaffiliated to take this further, and perhaps build a new way of engaging with spirituality that does not disrespect the cultural origins of its antecedents, but is not bound to it either.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2017/11/24/freedom-and-faith-open-source-religion/","tags":null,"title":"Freedom and faith - open source religion | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Religion impacts many aspects of our lives, and religious events are all around us, both positive and negative. Over the last few years, the idea of improving religious literacy has been gaining ground, with the launch of the Religious Literacy Project at the Harvard Divinity School in 2015, and the publication of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Religious Education’s report (Improving Religious Literacy) in 2016.\nBut what is religious literacy, and how is it different to religious education, comparative religion, or religious studies?\nFiona Bruce\u0026rsquo;s introduction to the APPG report makes it clear that religious literacy is not intended to be a vehicle for academic knowledge of core beliefs or essential practices - a sentiment echoed by Adam Dinham, author of Religious Literacy in Policy and Practice. He states in an interview with On Religion:\n ‘For me, it is not the ability to answer questions like ‘what are the Ten Commandments’ or ‘what language is the Qu’ran written in?’. It’s not a miraculous knowledge of more religious traditions and theologies than any one person could possibly hold in their heads’\nOn Religion, 2016\n Rather, as he goes on to elaborate elsewhere, religious literacy is a skillset, with three core elements:\n Understanding religion as a sociological phenomenon, not a monolithic entity Understanding the emotional and deeply personal nature of these behaviours and beliefs Building the knowledge we need, that is relevant to our area of interest  In other words, religious literacy means appreciating that religions are not neat boxes, they are filled with internal diversity, complex histories, and competing ideologies. This is the first skill - avoiding the trap of saying ‘Christians believe….’ or ‘Islam teaches…’.\nInterested in learning the basics of religious studies? Click here to join our free online course: How to Study Religion \nThe second skill means appreciating the personal disposition of adherents when talking about their traditions. We may find that though Roman Catholics believe a particular catechism, some do not feel very strongly about it, and it does not drive their daily life. The reverse is also possible, so care must be taken before drawing unfounded conclusions.\nThe final skill, based on the first two, is to look for information that is relevant to the people you are talking about. It might not matter what South Indian Hindus believe about Śiva if the religious adherents you are speaking to are Hindus from North India. Then again, it might be very important - you need the first two skills to find out.\nAt its core, religious literacy is a skillset that allows you to engage with religious events and individuals intelligently, without falling into some of the potholes that frequently cause difficulties in understanding. It encourages a mindset that is open and sympathetic to religiosity without being apologetic or doctrinal, and resists lumping people together - rather it looks first to the individual and the community to understand how they experience and express their religion.\nIt does not require you to say this or that religion is true, nor does it mean you cannot be critical or ask difficult questions. However, it does mean you are less likely to be misled by sensationalism and bigotry, and more inclined to hear both sides of a debate. It is important to be able to contextualise world events and narratives, and to appreciate the symbolism and significance behind otherwise obscure rituals, values, or practices.\nDinham suggests that people have neglected to talk about religion in an open and constructive way, and this has allowed these skills to atrophy; in place of intelligent understanding, ignorance and bigotry have become acceptable (or at least commonplace). It seems clear that religion is not going away, and if we hope to build a sustainable cultural landscape, we must find our own way to meaningfully engage with it.\nThe APPG report summarises the subject by stating: \u0026lsquo;\u0026hellip;improving religious literacy means equipping people with the knowledge and skills to understand and discuss religions and issues around them confidently, accurately and critically.\u0026rsquo;\nReligious literacy is a personal - and interpersonal - skill that facilitates a balanced and intelligent engagement with the religious aspects of human culture. It accepts diversity, resists simple labels, and seeks to contextualise and understand people in their own terms. As the world gets ever smaller, and cultures ever more intertwined, this skill can only become more important and relevant. Without it, the potential for misunderstanding, hatred, and even violence, can grow.\n","permalink":"https://oc-rs.org/2017/11/08/the-importance-of-religious-literacy/","tags":null,"title":"The importance of religious literacy | Blog | The Online Centre for Religious Studies"},{"categories":null,"contents":" About the OCRS important_devices Online As you might gather from our name, we're online!
